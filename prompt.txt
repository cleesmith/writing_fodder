World Description for "Hattie Gets A Gun"

SETTING OVERVIEW

"HattieGetsAGun" takes place in contemporary Buffalo, New York, likely in the 2010s or early 2020s. The story centers on an 83-year-old protagonist, Hattie Moon, and her friends as they navigate mysteries connected to a historical mansion and its former occupant.

The setting combines cozy small-town elements with darker undertones of mystery and crime. While featuring modern technology (smartphones, security cameras, DNA testing), the world retains a nostalgic quality, particularly through its senior protagonists who bridge past and present. The atmosphere shifts between warm, homey environments (Hattie's house, local diners) and the eerie, foreboding Elwood Mansion where much of the investigation takes place.

The narrative unfolds in a world where elderly amateur sleuths can access spaces and information through their perceived harmlessness, while navigating intergenerational relationships and maintaining their independence.

Humor and lightness vs. dark criminal history
Openness of friendship vs. secrecy of investigation

This creates a setting where everyday life exists alongside darkness, where elderly amateur detectives navigate both mundane concerns (baking, gardening) and serious crimes (murder, abduction), and where the past continually intersects with the present.

=== MANUSCRIPT ===


Chapter 1: I Gotta Get a Gun

“I gotta get a gun,” Hattie said while sipping her chocolate shake. “Like they have in those old movies. Something small, discreet that I can put in my purse.”

Cartney’s eyes narrowed. “You’re not serious.”

“I’m very serious. I’m sick of people trying to kill me. I’ve been lucky so far, but how long will that last?”

Muriel stopped chewing and stared off. “What are those things called? Snubbies? Or are they Saturday Night Specials?” Her questions hung in the air.

Hattie shrugged. “No clue. Anyway, I checked online and found this one called Violet Vixen. It has excellent reviews.”

Cartney reached for another fry. Between chews, she exhaled a heavy sigh. “Hattie, it’s a bad idea on so many levels. First and foremost, do you think you could shoot someone?”

“Well, of course. If it came down to any of us getting hurt, I’d have to.”

In a split second, Cartney reached across the table and yanked the shake out of Hattie’s hand.

For a moment, Hattie felt stunned, then gathered her senses. “Now, Cartney, I see your point, but my shake is not a gun.”

“But if it were, I’d have it.” Cartney pointed her index finger and said, “Pop,” as if shooting a gun at Hattie’s head.

Muriel spoke up. “Cartney, you should never point a gun at anyone.”

Cartney rolled her eyes and handed the shake back. “Hattie, listen to your friend.”

Muriel piped in. “But I want one too. If we’re both packin’, we’ll have a better chance.”

“Jeez.” The young woman shook her head. “I won’t be any part of this. You’ll have to find another driver.”

Muriel gave Hattie a slight nod.

Hattie wasn’t sure what Muriel meant. She’d have to ask when they were alone.

“And just so you know,” Cartney said, “you’ll have to get a background check and learn how to use it. It could take months.”

“I’m in no hurry.”

“That’s good. The longer, the better…” Cartney leaned forward. “Listen, in the meantime, why not try a personal alarm? They’re easy to use and can’t be used against you. All you have to do is pull the pin. The noise is deafening.”

“Do you have one?” Hattie asked.

“I do.” Cartney got a faraway look. “Somewhere... I’ll find it.” She glanced around the room. “Are you guys ready to go to Lewis’s and see about our next job?”

Both Hattie and Muriel nodded.

“Great, I need to stop in the bathroom. Be back in a sec.”

With Cartney gone, Hattie asked Muriel, “What was that nod about?”

Muriel leaned over and whispered, “Remember that guy we saw about hacking into a phone? He had an office down by the river.”

Hattie got a faraway look. “Oh, yeah.”

“Maybe he could get us a couple of guns? You know, on the down low.”

Hattie sat back, trying to think. “Do you remember his name? It started with a B.”

Muriel bit her lip. “It was a funny name. Like a cartoon character… Bonkers?”

Hattie frowned. “No, no. Bonkers was the guy who sold us that fake Rolex. This one’s different.”

Muriel snapped her fingers. “BamBam?”

“Close! But that’s the one with the baseball bat.” Hattie squinted, deep in thought. “Bogart?”

Muriel made a face. “Bogart is good. But I think it was more…detective-y.”

Hattie clapped her hands. “Something like Bubblegum.”

Muriel grinned. “Yes! Bubba!”

“Right! Bubba Gumshoe!” Hattie slapped the table triumphantly, relieved that even though their memories were shot, their brains together weren’t so bad. “Now, since Cartney doesn’t want to get involved, all we have to figure out is how to get there. I don’t have his number, so we’d have to knock on his door.”

Muriel shrugged. “I guess we could call a cab.”

Hattie got a faraway look. “I’m wondering how discreet a cabbie is. They keep records. I wouldn’t want Bubba to think we’d be blabbing our mouths.”

“Well, there’s Ralph. He’s always asking if we need a ride.”

Hattie sighed. “I love that guy, but he’s kinda nosy, and if Howie gets wind of this, I’m toast.”

“We could have Ralph drop us off at the coffee shop around the corner. He spends hours in those places. We could then walk to Bubba’s.”

Hattie thought for a moment, then smiled. Not a bad idea. What could go wrong?

Moments later, Cartney slipped into the booth.

While putting on lipstick, Muriel said, “You ladies ready to see Lewis for our next assignment?”

“Still glaming for the guy?” said Cartney.

Muriel pressed her lips together. “Yup.”

Cartney looked at Hattie. “What are we going to do with these two crazy kids?”

Hattie smiled. It was a rhetorical question. “Let’s hit it.”

And the three women headed for the car.

“His name is Flynn Elwood,” Lewis said. “When I first offered to help and petitioned the court to administer the estate, I thought it would be cut and dried, but matters have gotten…what’s the word…Flynni-fied.”

From beneath the table, Muriel kicked Hattie. On the ride to Lewis’s office, Muriel had mentioned that Lewis hadn’t been himself and was sorry he had taken on the case. Now, Hattie noticed how tired and pale he seemed.

Lewis took a deep sigh and opened a manila folder. “Before you fine ladies have any questions, let me vent.” He glanced up.

Hattie nodded. “By all means.”

Muriel and Cartney echoed Hattie’s sentiment.

“Flynn and I met at college. During freshman year, we took the same classes and became friendly. Not friends, mind you, but pleasant. We spoke to each other and shared notes. His grandfather was a doctor, very successful and well-known at the time. They lived in a brownstone downtown. It’s the same house you’ll be…scouring. But more on that later.

“He lived with his grandparents, mother, and father. There were no siblings or aunts or uncles. In other words, he grew up in a household of adults, which may explain a lot. We went our separate ways after college, but since he lived downtown, we’d often bump into each other on the street. He never had a job, and I assumed he lived off family money. Questions?”

“Where did the gentleman live?” Cartney asked.

“Over on Church by St. Dominics. Do you know the area?”

“Oh yeah. I know the place. It’s the only house on the block, next to the Red Dog. I used to play at that bar. Kinda setback, right?”

“Yeah, that’s it. It’s a large lot, and many people want to get their mitts on it. Prime location. Flynn was one of those people who seemed out of step with the rest of the world. He dressed impeccably, always in these old-fashioned, tailored suits that looked like they belonged to a different century. The suits may have been his grandfather’s. Anyway, there was always this distance about him. He’d often steer the conversation toward an opera he’d listened to, a forgotten town building, or some obscure family’s history. But if you tried to bring the conversation back to the present, he couldn’t relate.”

Lewis paused, looking at the women. “I guess what I’m trying to say is Flynn lived in a bubble, and none of the real-world stuff—responsibilities, deadlines, jobs—ever touched him.” He let out a heavy sigh. “And now, after his death, it’s all fallen to me to untangle the mess. And my dear ladies, it’s one hot mess, specifically his house. He was a hoarder, forgetful, and without a will. Any questions?”

Hattie spoke up. “How did he pass?”

“He got disoriented and ended up about four miles from home during a snowstorm. He froze to death. He was found when there was a thaw, by a guy walking his dog.”

“How sad,” Hattie said.

Lewis nodded and closed the file. “So, ladies, are you up for the challenge?” He gave a little laugh. “It would make my day if you were.”

Hattie, for one, was intrigued. It sounded like a portal into the past. Still, she had her concerns—it sounded like a big job. She looked warily at her friends. No one jumped in. Finally, Hattie took the reins. “Gee, Lewis, it’s exciting, but speaking for myself, I couldn’t possibly manage cleaning out such a large space.”

Her friends nodded in agreement.

Lewis’s face brightened. “Of course not. That’s not what I’m expecting.” He glanced at each of them. “There’s no cleaning involved.” He stood. “Let’s head over there now, and I’ll explain.”


Chapter 2: Yikes

“Yikes,” Hattie said as she scanned the front of the towering mansion.

“The bones are still good.” Lewis pointed. “Look at that brickwork. As solid and straight as the day they were laid. All it needs is a good cleaning and those vines cleared away.”

Hattie had her battles with those darn things and pointed to a second-floor window. “Lewis, I suspect they may have entered the house.”

“Very astute. ’Tis true,” he laughed. “Makes the wallpaper come alive.”

“Is there water damage?” Hattie asked.

“Oh yeah, a fair amount.”

Cartney spoke up. “I love the front double doors. They must be solid wood. Too bad some of the stained glass pieces have buckled and cracked.”

Lewis turned on his wry smile. “The passing of years... like knees and old friendships tend to buckle and crack. But a little wear and tear adds character, doesn’t it?”

Cartney nodded. “There’s beauty in imperfection. Wabi Sabi, you know? The cracks are part of the story. Makes the place more... real.”

Lewis chuckled. “Ah, the wisdom of an old soul.” He reached around Muriel’s waist. “So what do you think, my little Moon Pie?”

Cartney gave Hattie a sideward glance and mouthed, “Moon Pie?” Hattie responded with a discreet shrug.

Muriel smiled at Lewis. “It’s huge,” she said as her cheeks blushed. “I meant, you know, large, expansive.”

“Yes, yes.” He edged the small crowd toward the entryway and unlocked the front door.

The foyer, with its thick wainscoting, tall ceiling, gilded wallpaper, and rosebud chandelier, hinted at a home that had once been the pinnacle of elegance and care. But the hint of beauty was like that of an aging debutante, now crumbled from years of neglect. Water stains traced long fingers down the walls, cobwebs clung to corners, and the parquet floor, most likely once polished to a gleam, was deeply gouged and riddled with nuts. No doubt, squirrels had made their nests here.

Cartney ran her hand along the wallpaper. “It feels like it’s been painted. And the colors are remarkable.

Lewis nodded. “I suspect it was hand done in China. Cranes are often depicted for wisdom and longevity.”

Muriel looked at him with disbelief. “Jeez, Lewis, how do you know all this stuff?”

“I never run out of whys and whats. It’s a curse. So many questions. It gets overwhelming.” He leaned into Muriel. “And that’s why you are such a gem, my little Twinkie. I stop all such nonsense.”

Cartney shook her head, stifling a laugh. “Aw man, can you guys get a room?”

Muriel elbowed Lewis. “Only if he brings some real Twinkies.”

Lewis grinned. “I’ll stock up.”

They laughed as Lewis opened the secondary door that led inside.

Suddenly, gasps were heard.

Hattie was the first to mumble. “Oh my.” Cartney followed with “What the F,” and Muriel said dryly, “Well, I see the place is fully furnished… and then some.”

The garbage and trash were piled high over Hattie’s head. Boxes were scattered around, some half-folded and tossed aside. Pieces of furniture were mixed into the mess—an overturned chair with a broken leg, a small table on its side, and a dusty Victrola stuck out from under a pile of pillows and tangled curtain rods. She looked down the narrow hallway and up the staircase. The walls were barely visible, with torn wallpaper peeking through in spots. The stairs were covered with stacks of bulging plastic bags and more random junk, making it hard to see where one step ended and the next began. But the worst part was the smell. The air was thick with the odor of rot and mildew, heavy and stale. It smelled like dampness mixed with something sour, strong enough to tighten her throat. She covered her mouth and coughed.

“What is all this stuff?” Cartney asked in disbelief.

Hattie’s eyes fell on a broken doll, missing an eye. Its porcelain face was cracked and grimy. Suddenly, she felt chilled.

Muriel chuckled darkly. “And what’s the body count?”

Lewis grinned. “Listen, before you guys judge, there’s good news.”

Hattie glanced at her friends and stayed quiet.

He pointed to the stairs. “See along the banister where there’s a small path. I was able to climb up and toss stuff over the railing to gain access to the second floor. The upstairs, except for the ravages of time, is fairly pristine—”

Muriel interrupted. “Where did the man sleep?”

“Here. On the first floor. There’s a small cot in his grandfather’s doctor’s office. From what I can tell, that’s the entrance he used. There’s also a bathroom and a kitchen nearby. I’m not saying it’s great, but I suspect he used this area for storage. Anyway, that’s my assumption. I have a cleaning crew coming tomorrow, and they’re bringing bags and a dumpster. This area and the parlor, dining room, library, and kitchen will be cleared out within the week and can be command central. We’ll tackle the office area last. A deadbolt on the interior door heads into the main house. It’s locked from the office side. Anyway, since Flynn wasn’t the most organized, I’m hoping, given your stellar sleuth’s skills, you’ll be able to discover more about this place than meets the eye.”

Muriel smirked. “You mean besides the smell?”

Lewis chuckled. “Yeah, besides that.”

“So if we’re not clearing or cleaning, what’s the job?”

“Information... bank accounts, wills, stocks, treasury bonds, deeds, letters, journals, anything that can help us piece together Flynn’s financial situation and personal connections. There could be legal implications, especially if there’s an undiscovered will or undisclosed beneficiaries.”

“Wow,” Cartney said. “I see your dilemma.” She smiled. “Good, you have us around.”

Lewis sighed heavily. “That’s an understatement.”

* * *

On the ride home, Cartney asked, “So what do you think of the job?”

“As long as we don’t have to touch anything stinky, it should be fun,” Muriel said.

Hattie agreed. “Like a treasure hunt.”

As they drove in silence, Hattie’s brain was in overdrive. Flynn Elwood—was there an ‘e’ at the end of Flynn, and was it Ellwood or Elwood? Of course, it hardly mattered. She could check either name. She turned to Muriel. “Do you know when the gentleman died?”

Muriel bit the inside of her cheek. “I guess around the time we had that freak snowstorm. Maybe four weeks ago. Why do you ask?”

“Just curious.” When her words came out, Hattie saw Cartney’s eyes looking at her in the rearview mirror. Darn, that girl was sharp as a tack. Time to change the subject. “Cartney, how’s school going?”

“Great. I aced all my exams, and one of my professors said I should apply to the FBI after graduation.”

“Wow, Cartney,” Muriel said. “That’s impressive.”

The young woman laughed. “One would like to think so, except I think he wants to have sex with me.”

“Huh? You sure?”

Cartney shrugged. “The guy’s a blowhard, kinda military-ish. And…I don’t want to sound conceited, but he looks at me a lot.”

“Of course, he looks at you; you’re very pretty. Right, Hattie?”

Hattie nodded. “Men certainly like looking at attractive women.”

“Yeah, that’s true, but he creeps me out. I’ve been trying to figure it out. When a man looks at a woman and smiles, that’s one thing, but there’s something awry when he looks at her without emotion. Anyway, I could apply for the FBI with a criminal justice degree. I just need a couple of years of work experience. After some research, I might be able to use my private eye experience with a lawyer. At some point, I should talk with Lewis.”

Muriel clapped her hands. “Lewis would love to help you. He thinks you’re clever.”

“Really?”

“Yes, and self-assured and smart. The bee’s knees, I’d say.”

“Bee’s knees?” Cartney asked.

Hattie interjected. “The GOAT, as some would say.”

Cartney smiled. “I’m not sure about that.”

Muriel turned to Hattie. “GOAT? What the heck is a goat?”

“Greatest of all time.”

“Hattie Moon, you’re getting just like Lewis. The two of you make me feel old and out of touch.”

“Oh, Muriel,” Cartney said. “Stand proud. You’re the bee’s knees; no one can take that away from you.”


Chapter 3: How About a Drink?

After being dropped off by Cartney, Hattie asked Muriel, “How about a drink?”

Muriel shook her head. “I should get back home. It’s been a long day.”

Hattie was tired, too, but how could her dear friend not want a drink? “We could have a Baileys with lots of ice.”

“Um. I guess so.”

“Wonderful. Then I can make an omelet for dinner, or we could have a couple of pot pies if you want to be bad.”

Muriel shrugged. “Whatever you like.”

Something was up. “Muriel, what’s wrong?”

“Nothing.”

Hattie wasn’t going to take that as a final answer. “I’ll get the drinks, and we’ll talk.”

Muriel sat on the recliner. “I’ll be alright.”

In the kitchen, Hattie felt a little sick herself. Muriel had a doctor’s appointment earlier in the week. Was there bad news? The thought of losing her friend… Get a grip, she told herself. After all, a diagnosis was hardly a death sentence. She pulled two glasses from the cupboard, opened the freezer, and grabbed handfuls of ice for each drink. Rather than fill the glasses, she reached for the bottle of Baileys and put it on the tray. It might be a two-drink evening. Before leaving the kitchen, she said a little prayer.

After two long swigs, Muriel pulled the lever and reclined.

With her friend relaxed, Hattie dove in. “So, what’s up?”

Muriel took a deep breath. “Nothing, really.”

“Hmm. ‘Nothing really’ sounds like something more likely.”

Muriel chuckled. “Horsenuts. When gravy is gravy, what more can it be?”

Confused, Hattie blinked. “So this is about gravy? Okay, is it about making gravy or serving gravy?”

Her friend seemed a million miles away.

“I don’t believe we’ve ever discussed the advantages of flour over cornstarch,” Hattie said, hoping to lighten the mood.

“Hattie, it’s just gravy. Sometimes, we overthink things.”

“I see,” said Hattie. “So something is making you miserable, but it’s no big deal?”

“Exactly.”

Hattie looked at her friend kindly. “Well, will you tell me, or should we play charades?”

Muriel barked out a laugh. “You couldn’t possibly get it.”

“Is this one of your triple dog dares? Try me.”

Muriel looked off, then smiled. “Okay.” She lifted her hand and splayed five fingers.

“Okay, five words.”

Muriel nodded and showed one finger.

“First word,” Hattie said.

Muriel thought momentarily, then pointed to herself and made a heart symbol.

“It’s about something you love… Is it pie?”

Muriel rolled her eyes. “Not pie, Hattie.”

Hattie grinned. “Alright, alright. Something you love... Lewis?”

Muriel froze for a second and then nodded, a small, nervous smile on her lips. She held up two fingers.

Hattie leaned in. “Second word.”

Her friend stared off.

“Is that a clue? Or are you thinking?”

Muriel shook her head and lifted three fingers.

“Right,” Hattie said. “The first word is Lewis, and we’re skipping to the third word.”

Muriel nodded and walked two fingers across her lap.

“Lewis is going somewhere?”

Muriel then lifted another hand and had her two hands walking together on the arm of the recliner.

“Okay, so two people are together doing something.”

Muriel pointed to her nose.

“Great! So where are you guys going?”

Muriel’s face crumbled. “No,” she said.

Worried that her friend would start crying, Hattie said, “Oh, Muriel, can you please tell me.”

Seemingly lost for words, Muriel made the sign for a heart, then held something in both hands and cracked it apart.

Hattie understood. “Your heart is broken.”

Her friend took a deep breath, then blurted out, “I think Lewis is cheating on me.”

Hattie’s jaw dropped. The room felt utterly still. She shook her head in disbelief. “Well, horsenuts indeed.”

Muriel’s lip quivered, and before she could say anything, Hattie stood up. “You know what? Forget the Baileys. We need something stronger.”

When Hattie returned to the living room with two shots of whiskey, she found Muriel wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her sweater.

“Oh, honey. Let me get you a tissue,” Hattie said, handing over the box. As they settled into their chairs, Hattie wasn’t sure how to broach the subject.

As if reading her thoughts, Muriel sniffled and said, “I know what you’re thinking. It seems impossible, but I don’t understand what else could explain his behavior.” She reached for the shot glass and downed it in one quick gulp. “I’m such a loser.”

“Now, Muriel, cut that out. I won’t hear it,” Hattie said firmly.

“Really? Hattie, I’m in deep. I’ve fallen in love for the first time in my life, and I don’t know what the friggin fruitcake I’m supposed to do now that I’m being rejected. It’s awful. I can’t sleep. It’s eating me alive.”

Hattie sighed, unsure of what to say. She knew the feeling all too well—it was exactly how she felt after Orin passed. Life had drained of joy, leaving behind only the melancholy of memories. Her heart ached for Muriel. If only she could offer something that would help. Her gaze wandered to Orin’s picture on the buffet. “You may not know this, but I talk to my husband,” she said.

Muriel blinked, her brow furrowing. “What?”

“I talk to Orin,” Hattie repeated, pointing to the picture. “Over there. Have I ever mentioned it?”

Muriel glanced at the photo, then shook her head. “I don’t think so.”

“It’s been years. At first, I just wanted to break the silence in this house. But guess what? At some point, he started talking back to me.”

Muriel’s eyes flickered to her empty shot glass. Hattie slid the bottle over. “Not in words exactly,” she explained, “but in my mind. We’ve had amazing conversations.”

Muriel downed the second shot, her face twisting at the burn. “Well, that’s wonderful for you, Hattie,” Muriel said, her voice cracking. “But I guess if Lewis were dead, I could try expressing my feelings. He’s still alive, though.”

“Yes, exactly. You’re ahead of the game.”

“Huh?”

“Muriel, Lewis is alive. You can talk to him directly about your concerns.”

Muriel looked away. “No. I couldn’t possibly.”

“And why not?”

“I don’t want to hold him back. If he’s in love with someone else, he should be free to be with her. I have nothing to offer him.”

“So, you’re not going to talk to him? Okay, I get that,” Hattie said gently. “But surely you can talk to me. Muriel, what happened?”

Muriel sighed. “We were supposed to go to a movie last Friday. It was all set, but he didn’t call or show up.”

“Did you try to reach him?”

Muriel shook her head. “I didn’t want to bother him.”

“Of course, but contacting him wouldn’t have been unreasonable.”

“I was afraid. I didn’t want to know what happened. I thought maybe he was in a car accident or got sick. What kind of girlfriend avoids hearing bad news? Anyway, I just kept watching the clock, giving myself deadlines. I’d text him if he didn’t call me by nine or ten or midnight.”

“And did you?”

“No, it was too late. So, I just stayed up all night waiting for the next day. He called me late that morning and said he was sorry but got busy with work. He told me he couldn’t see me on Saturday night either.”

Hattie frowned. “He didn’t explain, and you didn’t ask?”

“Oh, Hattie, I don’t want him to tell me he’s made a mistake and it’s over. I don’t want to know.”

Hattie rubbed her forehead, her thoughts swirling. Poor Muriel. But something didn’t sit right. “You two seemed happy today,” she said softly. “He called you his Moon Pie.”

“I know,” Muriel’s face crumbled. “I’m so confused.”

Life jacket. Hattie needed to throw one over to her friend. “Muriel, would you like me to speak with Lewis?”

A look of horror erupted on Muriel’s face. “No, Hattie. Please don’t. I have to figure this out myself.”

Hattie nodded. “Yes, of course.”

Her friend’s face brightened. “Maybe it was just work after all. I’ve never known Lewis to lie. It was only last week that it happened.”

“Makes sense. No reason to think the worst.”

A phone rang. “That’s mine.” Muriel reached for her purse and mouthed, “It’s Lewis.”

Hattie whispered, “Should I go into the kitchen?”

“Don’t be silly…” She tapped the phone. “Hey, Lewis.”

Hattie sat politely.

“Yes, we’re all excited about the job. It should be interesting… Okay. I’ll speak with Cartney… That’s a good idea…” Muriel gave Hattie a look. “No problem… Lunch on Monday sounds great… Yes. I miss you too… Bye-bye.” After disconnecting, Muriel stared off.

“Everything okay?” Hattie asked.

Her friend took a deep, shaky breath.

Something was wrong. Hattie waited.

Muriel’s eyes fell on her. “He’ll be busy this weekend but will meet us at the house on Monday. I have to make sure Cartney can drive—” And she broke into tears.

“Oh, Muriel.”

Between gasps, Muriel managed, “Something is wrong. I feel it in my bones.” She looked off. “Maybe I said something stupid or hurtful. You know, it wouldn’t be the first time.”

Hattie shook her head. “No, that’s not it. He loves your humor. He’s always smiling when he’s with you. But I have to say, something does seem off.”

“Yes,” Muriel said, seemingly comforted.

Suddenly, Hattie had an idea. It wasn’t the best; it was devious, but desperate times called for desperate measures. “We could do surveillance.”

Muriel reared back. “What?! On my boyfriend? On our boss?”

Hattie felt a wry smile come to her lips. “Not unheard of; besides, we’re darn good at it.”

“I don’t know. What if he finds out?”

“Muriel, if nothing is happening, he’ll be flattered.”

“I’m not so sure about that. If he had me under surveillance, I would be creeped out.”

“Good point. So… are you going to talk to him instead?”

Muriel chewed the inside of her cheek. “I already said I can’t do that… so what’s the plan?”

“We could stake out his house, but then we’d have to see if Cartney can drive us.”

Muriel shook her head. “I don’t think Cartney would agree to do anything behind Lewis’s back.”

“Hmm… You may be right.” Hattie recalled a recent online search she had done. “Muriel, have you ever heard of location sharing?”

Muriel looked at her, confused. “Location what?”

“Location sharing. Sometimes, people don’t even realize they’ve got it turned on. Did Lewis ever use your phone to check on something?”

Muriel shrugged. “Well, there was the time he ordered a pizza. He was at my house, and he wanted to find out where there was a pizzeria on the way to his place.”

Hattie clapped her hands. “If Lewis logged into his Google account from your phone, you might be able to see where he is right now. Like, this very second.”

Muriel blinked. “Huh? Like… tracking him?”

“Yes. I guess you could say that.” Hattie leaned forward. “Check your phone. If location sharing is turned on, you could know exactly where he is now.”

Muriel hesitated. “That feels… sneaky.”

Hattie chuckled. “Oh, it’s sneaky, all right. But we’re not following him around in trench coats. Just a peek. A tiny, harmless peek.” She gave Muriel her most innocent smile, though she doubted it was convincing.

With a sigh, Muriel unlocked her phone and followed Hattie’s instructions. Hattie watched closely as Muriel’s face went pale.

“What is it?” Hattie asked.

Muriel nodded slowly. “OMG! He’s shared it. I can see where he is right now.”

Hattie leaned in. “So, where’s he at?”

“Home,” Muriel muttered, staring at her phone. “He’s at home.”

Hattie couldn’t help grinning. “See? Nothing to it. Now you’ve got a little window into his world. You don’t have to wonder where he’s at—just check your phone, and voilà.”

Muriel looked up, eyes wide. “This feels so wrong.”

Hattie shrugged. “Well, only if you make it wrong. You’re just making sure everything’s on the up and up. You don’t have to check every five minutes—just enough to give yourself some peace of mind.”

Muriel sighed. “And if I find out something’s wrong?”

“Then we’ll deal with it,” Hattie said. “But wouldn’t you rather know for sure?”

Muriel bit her lip, glancing back at the blinking dot on her screen. “I guess so,” she finally said. “But I’m not going to stalk him.”

“Of course not! Simply a casual check-in. No harm, no foul.”

When Muriel stood to leave, Hattie said, “Keep me posted. If something doesn’t feel right, we’ll figure it out. We’ve got this, Muriel.”


Chapter 4: No Place to Go

With no place to go or anyone to see, Hattie made herself a nice cup of tea with lingonberry toast and fired up the laptop. She then planted her fingers on the keyboard and typed: Flynn, Flynne, Ellwood, Elwood, obituary.

The notice popped onto the screen before Hattie could bite her toast:

Flynn Elwood, 70, of Buffalo, NY, passed away unexpectedly following a sudden snowstorm and was discovered on April 4. A lifelong resident of Buffalo, Flynn was the grandson of Dr. Frederick Elwood, a well-known physician in the community.

Flynn lived a reclusive life in the family’s historic home and was the last surviving member of the Elwood family. Flynn is preceded in death by his parents and grandparents. Services will be held privately.

And so it went, Hattie thought—a life and legacy with little fanfare. Out of curiosity, she searched “Elwood Mansion.” A recent article from the Gazette came up:

A Buffalo Landmark Fades into History

The Elwood Mansion on Church Street, once a symbol of Buffalo’s social elite, has fallen into disrepair following the death of its last resident, Flynn Elwood. Built by Dr. Frederick Elwood, a renowned local physician, the mansion was a hub of social and medical prominence in the early 20th century.

Flynn Elwood, who lived reclusively in the mansion, was found deceased following a freak snowstorm in March. His passing marks the end of the Elwood family’s direct connection to the property.

Though the home has deteriorated, preservationists hope to restore the historic mansion—a reminder of Buffalo’s storied past.

Saddened, Hattie sat back and recalled her days walking to school, passing so many beautiful homes on Richway with their wrought-iron fences, wide front yards, and colorful gardens. She and her friends would make up stories about the people who lived inside, crafting elaborate fantasies about balls and banquets. But none of them had ever been inside—not that she could remember. Knowing the Elwood Mansion stood empty, she felt an odd tug of sadness, as though part of her childhood had crumbled along with its weathered stones.

After a bite of toast and the sweet-and-sour taste of lingonberries, she had another thought and typed: “Worth of Elwood Mansion.” Buried in a historical property forum, she found the following:

The Elwood Mansion, though in a state of disrepair, is valued at approximately $5.2 million due to its historic significance and prime location in Buffalo’s once-prestigious Church Street neighborhood. Preservationists estimate that a complete restoration would cost upwards of $2.5 million, but its potential value post-restoration could reach $8 million or more.

Wow, Hattie thought. It was hard to believe the property she had just visited could be worth this much.

She tapped her fingers on the keyboard and thought of something else Lewis had said—Flynn was found four miles from his house in an open field after that freak snowstorm. Four miles?

She pulled up her browser and typed: “weather report, Buffalo, freak snowstorm March.” The results popped up immediately. Her eyes skimmed the particulars: 22 inches of snow, air temperature 15°F… 30-mile-per-hour winds… wind chill -5°F.

Hattie stared at the numbers, her mind piecing them together. She could still hear the howling winds from that night and remember how bitterly cold it had been—the kind of cold that stung the skin and made every breath feel like ice.

She did a quick search for frostbite and hypothermia risks at those temperatures. The results confirmed what she suspected: at -5°F wind chill, frostbite could start in as little as 30 minutes, and hypothermia could set in even sooner. She clicked on a few more articles.

Twenty-two inches of snow would have slowed anyone to a crawl—exhausting conditions.

Hattie leaned back and stared at the screen. The question quietly gnawing at her now came to the forefront. How could he have walked four miles in that kind of weather?

The answer was obvious: he couldn’t have—not in those conditions. It didn’t matter how desperate he was; no one could have walked four miles through that snow, in that bitter cold, against that wind, without collapsing long before they covered that distance.

Hattie’s heart pounded. The pieces didn’t fit. There had to be another explanation.

* * *

“Do you mind if I come over?”

It was Muriel.

“Of course not. I’ll toss in those pot pies Howie brought over. How are you doing?”

A deep sigh came over the connection. “Nothing new.”

Hattie shook her head. Gosh, darn it. What was going on with Lewis? Well, there was one way to find out. “Muriel, make sure you bring your phone.”

Once settled in the kitchen, waiting for dinner, Hattie brought out the whiskey. “We need to be good. Not terribly good, but good enough.”

Muriel smiled weakly and pushed the shot glass toward Hattie. “Yes, a little liquid encouragement may be the ticket.”

Her friend’s hand trembled when she reached for the whiskey glass.

“I don’t know how much longer I can do this,” Muriel muttered. “I can’t keep this up. My mind is going round and round. Sometimes, I think I’m my own worst enemy. But why isn’t he talking to me?”

“Jeez, Muriel, that’s a darn good question. It seems like you two always talk about stuff.”

Muriel nodded, her hand gripping the glass tighter. “That’s why I think there’s something wrong, something he doesn’t want me to know about... Hattie, maybe he’s getting treatments. You know, for the Big C.”

Hattie couldn’t disagree; it wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibilities. A lot of people keep to themselves when they’re sick. “Yes, that certainly happens, and maybe he doesn’t want to upset you. Have you checked where he might be today?”

Muriel shook her head. “I need moral support. Are you ready?”

“Sure,” Hattie said.

Muriel took a deep breath, pulled her phone from her pocket, and pressed some buttons. As she stared at the readout, her face went pale and expressionless. “What the blooming bullcrap is ‘The Mercury Club’?”

Hattie froze. “The what?”

“Mercury Club. It’s downtown. Lewis is there.” She turned the phone around for Hattie to see.

She’d heard of the Mercury Club before—vaguely, in passing—but something about it had always struck her as off. “I think… it’s a gentlemen’s club,” she said, secretly wondering if it was a strip club.

Muriel’s face screwed up. “What the frig is a gentlemen’s club?”

“I’m not sure. Let me get my laptop.”

In no time, the search scrolled onto the screen, and Hattie read it aloud:

“The Mercury Club, established in the early 1900s, is one of Buffalo's most exclusive gentlemen’s clubs. Located in a grand, historic building downtown, the club is known for its old-world charm, privacy, and strict membership policies. The Mercury Club offers luxurious amenities, including private dining rooms, a cigar lounge, and exclusive events for its wealthy and influential members. Its reputation as a discreet and prestigious social hub makes it a favored gathering place for the city’s elite.”

Muriel’s lips thinned into a bitter smile. “Well, I guess I won’t have to check on hospital admissions.”

Hattie took a sip of whiskey. Lewis’s behavior was a mystery. “I’m calling him,” she blurted.

“Hattie, you can’t do that.”

Hattie stood. “Now, where the heck is my phone?”

“But then he’ll know we’re talking about him.”

“Now, Muriel,” Hattie said in a schoolmistress tone, “it’s not about what I’m going to say; it’s about what we hear.”

“Huh?”

“Oh, there it is, on the counter.” She reached over and grabbed it. “Now, I’m putting it on speakerphone.”

“But I can’t talk. I—”

“No, no. Just listen. Is there music in the background? A woman’s voice? Just pay attention. I’ll handle all the yada, yada.”

Muriel took a deep breath and exhaled. “Okay. Got it.”

Hattie pressed Lewis’s number and set the phone between them. Each ring seemed interminable when suddenly his voice came through strong and clear. “Hey, Hattie. And to what do I owe this honorable call?”

“Muriel and I are going shopping tomorrow and were wondering if we should pick up some bags or boxes for the job.”

“No, it won’t be necessary. I’ve arranged to have all the supplies you’ll need.”

“I see,” Hattie said. Unsure of what else to say, she let more words spill from her mouth. “Let me ask Muriel if she has any questions. I’ll put her on speaker.”

Hattie glanced at Muriel. The poor woman looked horrified.

“Oh, sure,” he said.

Hattie waited for Muriel to speak. “Hey, Lewis,” she finally managed.

“How’s my Moon Pie?”

Moon Pie?

“Ah. Good, thanks,” Muriel answered.

“Do you have any questions?”

“Of course. I mean, well… I’m trying to schedule some appointments for the week. What days were you hoping to have us do the job?”

“Right. Doesn’t matter. You guys can work around your schedule. I know most of Cartney’s classes are in the evening, but I think she attends them one full day a week. You might check with her.”

“Yes. That’s a good idea.”

“So, what are you gals doing tonight?”

“Just sitting around... How about yourself?”

Hattie raised her thumb.

“Work. Listen, how about I stop by tomorrow night? I’ll bring a pizza.”

Muriel’s face brightened. “I’d like that.”

“Great! See you then.”

After goodbyes, Hattie hung up the phone and glanced at Muriel, who beamed. “Thank you, Hattie,” she said softly. “You’re the bestest friend ever.”

Seeing how happy her friend was, filled Hattie with perfect joy.

After Muriel left, Hattie thought about Cartney and her drunk calls. The young woman’s stories were very amusing. As Hattie plumped the couch pillows, she had a little giggle. After eighty-three years, her ‘bad self’ finally made its first drunk call.


Chapter 5: Trip to Bubba’s

Hattie looked out the window to see if Ralph’s car was in his driveway. It was. She glanced at the clock—perfect timing—and punched in his number.

“Hey, Hattie. Is anything wrong?”

Ralph always tended to be glum. “No, Ralph. All systems go. Listen, I wondered if you’d be interested in driving Muriel and me over to see a friend. It won’t be a long visit, maybe half an hour. There’s a nice café around the corner where you could eat or have coffee.”

“Time?”

He was also a man of few words. “Whatever is convenient for you.”

“Totally open.”

“Okay. In an hour or so. We’ll walk over.”

“Gotcha,” he said, and the line went dead.

So today was “gun day,” ironically a Sunday. Hattie smiled. Gunday. She’d have to mention that to Muriel—funny, right? She punched in Muriel’s number. “Spoke with Ralph. He’ll drive us to Bubba’s in about an hour… Great. See you then.”

Hattie brushed her teeth and settled down at the kitchen table. She tapped her pen on the tabletop, then began to write:

Hello Bubba,

We met once when you helped me unlock a phone. I just wanted to say it worked like a charm—thanks again! Now, about something else... I’m looking to buy a small gun, something like a Violet Vixen, but I’m flexible. The main thing is it needs to fit in my purse.

Time’s a bit tight (I could kick the bucket tomorrow), so I’d like to find an independent seller ASAP. Could you point me in the right direction? I have no plans to use it (fingers crossed!), but given a few recent threats, I figure it’s better to be safe. I’m sure there are rules around gun ownership, but with the Second Amendment and all, I assume I can skip the rigamarole.

Thanks again,

Hattie Moon

She reread her note and then added her phone number.

* * *

“Gosh darn it,” Hattie said, standing at Bubba’s door. “I guess he’s not home. I figured this might happen. I wrote a note, and I’ll put it—”

Muriel reached for Hattie’s arm and whispered, “The curtain in the window just moved.”

Hattie knocked again and raised her voice. “Bubba, I suppose you don’t remember—”

Suddenly, the door swung open. “Sorry, ladies. I was doing yoga and had to put on a robe.” He glanced behind them and motioned them inside. “Come in, come in.”

Nothing much had changed. He lived and worked in a single room where everything was within reach.

Hattie recalled how he resembled Columbo. Only today, he was a wiry, white-haired guy in orange. Unsure he was wearing anything beneath his robe, she said, “I’m sorry, I couldn’t find your number. We can come back another—”

“Don’t be silly. Come on in.”

As he stepped aside, Hattie glanced at Muriel, who seemed to be blushing.

In two steps, the three of them were standing on a carpet patch. He looked around. “Let’s see, where are those folding chairs? Oh, never mind.” The bed was unmade. With a few quick snaps of a comforter, he offered them a place to sit.

“It’s wonderful to see you ladies again,” he said, rolling his computer chair over. “How’s Lewis?”

Muriel jumped in. “He’s doing great. Right, Hattie?”

“Yes. Very well.”

Bubba clapped his hands. “Wonderful… So what can I do for you today?”

Suddenly, Hattie felt out of sorts. How exactly does someone ask someone else to do something possibly illegal? Or was it illegal? She smiled nervously as both Bubba and Muriel looked at her.

“Let’s see, where should I start?” Glancing at the note still in her hand, she said, “Not to state the obvious, but I’m not getting any younger.”

Muriel looked puzzled, while Bubba smiled sweetly and said, “None of us are.”

“Anyway, I had a dream the other night. Oh, it’s too much to go into now, but after I woke up, I decided that I needed to get a gun.”

At the mention of a gun, Bubba leaned forward. “What kind of gun?”

“A small gun, you know, for my purse.”

“I see,” he said.

“And a purple one would be nice,” Hattie added.

Muriel chimed in. “I’d like one too.”

He laughed, leaning back in his chair. “Why are you coming to me and not a gun shop?”

“I can’t wait. Not enough time. I had a dream.”

Bubba’s face turned serious. “A dream? What kind of dream?”

“I dreamt about my husband, Orin. He often comes to me in dreams. We were putting together a puzzle on the dining room table. It was a state puzzle. Anyway, one last piece remained—Idaho—but we couldn’t find it. We looked everywhere—under the table, between couch cushions, on the floor—then I woke up.”

Muriel was the first to speak. “What does this have to do with a gun?”

“Well, um… Idaho is shaped like a gun.”

Muriel’s face screwed up. “You didn’t mention that to me. You said you were worried for your safety.”

“I know, Muriel, I’m sorry. It just seemed more rational than saying I had a dream with my husband where we were missing the state of Idaho, and I thought he was telling me to get a gun. He often tells me stuff that’s important… Yeah, I’m a little off. Okay, maybe more than just a little.” Hattie turned to Bubba. “I’m sorry for wasting your time.”

“Not at all. Your reasoning makes sense.”

“Really?” Hattie managed.

“Most definitely. We don’t live in the world; we live in a universe of energy that, while seemingly chaotic, is actually in beautiful order and purposeful. Imagination is where truth manifests.”

Muriel’s eyes widened.

“Anyway, I take such flights of fancy very seriously. We all should.”

Hattie exhaled and felt her shoulders relax.

He clapped once. “Now, let’s talk logistics. I take it neither of you has a pistol permit.”

Both women nodded.

“If you plan on getting pistol permits, it’s doable but lengthy. Now, if you want to carry it in a purse, a judge must approve the request, and you need an awfully good reason. In other words, getting approval for concealed carry is a long shot—very long. No pun intended.”

Hattie giggled, hoping her disappointment wasn’t too obvious.

“Hattie,” Muriel said, “maybe we should look into getting one of those personal alarm things Cartney talked about.”

“Yes, that makes sense for you, Muriel, but I think Orin was trying to tell me something.”

Muriel reached over and squeezed Hattie’s hand. “Yes. Of course. I understand.”

Both women turned to Bubba.

“Okay. Not to mention the obvious, but there are many roads from A to B. The one you might be interested in is Horatio. Use that name when you contact him.” He spun around and opened a desk drawer.

After rummaging through, he pulled out a card. “Oh, yes, here’s one.” He passed the card to Hattie. “You’ll need this. When you contact him, just say you’re a friend of mine and mention the Idaho puzzle.”

Hattie glanced at Muriel, whose raised eyebrows mirrored her unease.

“He’s a facilitator of sorts. Just don’t ask too many questions. He’s the kind of man who doesn’t like questions. Stick to your needs, and you’ll get what you want.”

Hattie looked at the card. It had an H and a phone number—nothing else. She slipped it into her purse. “Thank you,” she said.

He stood. “My pleasure, ladies.”

As they walked to the diner, Muriel slipped her arm through Hattie’s. “Well, that was quite the visit.”

Hattie agreed, recalling her dream and how Orin’s face had been so calm, so sure.

“I guess it’s official,” Muriel said. “We’ve entered the underground. It’s about time. Bring it.”

Hattie stopped and turned to face her friend. “What if it wasn’t about the gun at all? What if the dream was about something else we’re not seeing yet?”

Muriel shrugged.

Hattie looped her arm through Muriel’s again and continued walking. “I guess we’ll find out.”


Chapter 6: Monday Morning

As they drove to the mansion, Hattie asked, “How was the pizza last night?”

Muriel twisted around from the front passenger seat and faced Hattie. “Wonderful. I mean, delicious.”

“That’s nice. What kind did you order?”

“We tried a white pizza. It had fresh tomatoes, basil, smoked salmon, and capers.”

“Sounds very sophisticated.”

Cartney joined in, eyes still on the road. “Hands down, pizza is a culinary canvas.”

“What a wonderful observation,” Muriel chuckled. “May I steal it?”

“It’s yours,” Cartney said with a wink.

Muriel turned back to Hattie, visibly relaxing. “I was silly to worry.”

“That’s great to hear,” Hattie said gently.

Cartney stopped at a red light, tapping her fingers on the steering wheel. “What were you worried about?”

Muriel hesitated. After the light changed, she said, “Lewis has been busy the last couple of weekends, and I wasn’t sure what was happening.”

“Did you ask him?”

Another pause, longer this time. “No.”

Cartney glanced over. “Why not?”

“Oh, Cartney, I’ve been through this with Hattie already. Anyway, it all worked out.”

“You talked to Hattie and not me? I’m miffed. After all, I’m the one with all the friggin’ experience around here.”

Muriel’s face softened into a genuine smile. “We did a sneaky thing. It was Hattie’s idea.”

Cartney grinned. “Gotta watch Hattie. She’s out of control. Now spill it—what did you two cook up?”

“On Saturday night, we tracked him down using my phone app and called him.”

“What app was that?”

“It’s a Google thing where you share your location.”

“Yeah. I know that one. Maybe we should all link to it.”

Hattie laughed. “Sure, except I’m only at my house or with you guys.”

Muriel added, “Ditto.”

“Anyway, great detective work. Way to go. So where was he?”

“At the Mercury Club.”

“Mercury Club? Wow. Upscale.”

“You know the place?”

Cartney nodded. “I went there for a job interview. The guy was a ‘mature gentleman’—in quotes—who wanted someone to organize his library. The place is old-school—tablecloths, fine china, dimmed lights. Very proper. Anyway, he asked me if I liked to be tied up.”

Muriel’s eyes went wide. “Excuse me?”

Cartney barked out a laugh. “I told him only if he used a proper sailor’s knot.”

“A sailor’s knot?” Muriel asked, bewildered.

“Yeah.” Cartney grinned. “You know, those knots sailors use—strong enough to hold a boat steady but easy to untie when you need a quick escape. Figured if he tied me up, I’d better make sure I could get the hell out.”

“So did he… you know?”

“Tie me up? Hell no. I had a nice dinner, then bailed while he was in the john. He never called back about the job, thank God.”

Muriel fell silent and turned to look out the window.

“Muriel,” Hattie said softly, “Cartney’s story isn’t Lewis’s.”

“For sure,” Cartney added. “The Mercury Club is mainly for rich guys to schmooze and make deals. I can’t imagine Lewis being part of anything shady.”

Hattie exhaled and settled back into the seat, relieved to see Muriel’s shoulders relax. The last thing she wanted was for Muriel to start obsessing again.

As they turned into the long, winding driveway of the Elwood Mansion, the trees filtered soft rays of morning light across the car, making the place feel magical. Lewis stood in front of the building, hands clasped, waiting.

The car stopped. Muriel got out quickly and hurried to Lewis.

As the two others lagged behind, Cartney leaned toward Hattie and whispered, “Let me know if you need eyes inside the Mercury Club. I can get in. I know people who work in the kitchen.”

Hattie stopped mid-step. “What?”

“I can check it out.” Cartney shook her head. “Men. Oh, brother.”


Chapter 7: The Parlor

Entering the house, Hattie blinked hard. The mountains of stuff that had taken over the hall were gone—completely. Expecting the musty staleness, she sniffed the air. Only a faint hint of citrus—crisp and light—lingered.

“Come this way,” Lewis said, leading them to the parlor.

Hattie stood at the doorway. Her glance wandered around the room, following the paintings—landscapes, still lifes, and portraits in gilded, thick, ornate frames. What the heck?

“Look,” Muriel said, pointing to a small side table. A porcelain tea set—delicate, dainty—sat as if waiting for company.

Hattie walked over. The roses painted along the edge of the cup were faded, but she could still make them out, along with the thin gold rim circling the saucer. She wondered if whoever cleaned had also taken the time to stage a charming setting.

“This place is awesome,” Cartney said. “It’s a time capsule.”

Hattie couldn’t disagree. She sauntered to a portrait of a young woman in a white dress with a cinched waist and a tiered, full skirt. After a century, the woman’s unsmiling face and distant haughtiness seemed more like an artifact—impersonal and cold.

Cartney sidled up. “Do you think she lived here?”

Hattie pulled her gaze away and looked around the room. There was a spot by a front window where trailing-rose wallpaper mirrored the background of the painting. She pointed. “Over there. She may have sat for the artist in that corner. It’s the same design… but the wallpaper has darkened. Probably with the years.”

Cartney stepped along the carpet, assessed the spot, then returned. “Yes. I think you’re right. So who do you think it is?”

Hattie shrugged. “According to Lewis, two women were in the household—Flynn’s mother and grandmother.” She closed in, examined the painting more carefully, then stood back and pointed. “The neck is open, the sleeves are short, and the overlay resembles chiffon. Since the gown looks more Edwardian than Flapper, I guess it could be his grandmother.”

“Wow. Hattie, how do you know all this stuff?”

“I watched Downton Abbey.”

With a resounding “Ahem,” Lewis clapped his hands.

Hattie turned.

“Ladies, now that we have some open space, let’s gather around and discuss the plan.”

As the women settled onto the ancient furniture, Hattie perked up her ears.

“Okay,” Lewis said, pacing in front of the fireplace, his hands tucked into his pockets. “Here’s the game plan. I see this job as mining for gold. But what is gold?” He paused, turning to face the group. “Gold isn’t just shiny metal—it’s value, hidden and buried. And finding it? That’s hard work.”

He scanned the room for reactions. “Now, in this house, there’s gold—documents, papers, and anything that’ll help us settle the estate. But we have to find it.”

Cartney perched on the edge of the sofa. “Okay, but what exactly are we looking for? Gold’s a great metaphor, but what will help you settle the estate?”

Lewis nodded, stepping forward. “Good question. Here’s what we’re after: anything legal or financial—wills, deeds, bank statements, insurance policies, canceled checks—anything that establishes ownership or clears up debts. Even receipts or scraps of paper with account numbers scribbled on them might be important.”

He paused and glanced around the room. “But it’s not just the obvious stuff. Sometimes, the gold is hidden in the smallest details. Letters, ledgers, and even sticky notes could be the missing pieces. Hoarders have a way of tucking important things into random spots.”

Muriel spoke up. “What about his bedroom? People usually keep important stuff there.”

Lewis hesitated, a faint smile tugging at his lips. “Yes. We’ll get to that. It’s unsettling—sleeping in a medical office surrounded by exam tables, filing cabinets, and whatever else he dragged in over the years. Still, I suspect it may be the most important area because, as you suggested, Muriel, it seems he spent most of his time there. For now, I think the kitchen is a good starting point. It’s the most cleared out and shouldn’t take as long. People stash everyday things like bills, receipts, or cash in drawers or tins. After that, we’ll tackle the library. The place is packed with books—on shelves, tables, even on the floor. Then there’s a huge rolltop desk, overloaded cabinets, and file drawers. I suspect Flynn would have hidden stuff in books, perhaps with documents shoved between pages or notes in the margins. It’ll be a needle-in-a-haystack situation, but it’s worth checking. About the dining room. After the general cleaning, it looks fine. I’ve already checked the china cabinet and buffet. I’ll call an antique dealer I know to see if he’d like it. That leaves the office for last.”

“What about upstairs?”

“Looks like he didn’t go up there. Still, we’ll have to play it by ear.”

Cartney recapped, “Kitchen then library. Got it. How do you want to handle all the junk?”

“I’ve placed boxes and large garbage bags in each room. We’ll work one room at a time. But don’t haul anything out. We’re not here to clean the place; we’re here to find the important stuff. I don’t want anyone wasting time tidying up. Focus on the task: if it’s junk, bag it; if it’s in good condition, put it in a box for donation; and if looks important, set it aside.”

He patted his pockets, pulled out a card, and handed it to Hattie. “When ready, call this gentleman to haul away stuff. His name is Mike Grady. He used to help Flynn with repairs and other small jobs around the house. I’ve already spoken with him, and he’s happy to help.”

Hattie slipped the man’s name into her purse. “Will do.”

Lewis clapped his hands. “Great! We’re off to the races… Oh, and one more thing. How about I take you ladies to lunch?”

Muriel blurted out, “We’d love that!”


Chapter 8: Lunch at the Stuyvesant

The Stuyvesant sat tucked into the folds of downtown, its dark brick facade and brass-framed windows reflecting the sun. Heavy oak doors creaked slightly as Lewis pushed them open, revealing an interior dimly lit with warm, amber light. The air smelled faintly of polished wood, aged leather, and the distant aroma of roasted coffee.

An older man in a black vest approached, his shoes making soft taps against the hardwood floor. “Lewis, how nice to see you today. And you have guests.”

“Guests. How kind.” Cartney laughed. “We’re his posse.”

“Posse?”

“They’re my angels,” Lewis said with a wry smile.

“Angels?” The man chuckled. “Well, you’re in good hands then.”

Cartney grinned. “The best hands, even though we left our halos at home.”

With a glint in his eyes, Lewis added, “They prefer to shine in other ways.”

The man nodded, amusement flickering in his gaze. “Yes. I see that. Come this way, won’t you?”

Tucked into one side of the large room was an alcove with round seating. The muted hum of conversations, the faint clinking of glassware, and the occasional hiss from the kitchen created a comforting backdrop. The waiter passed around four menus.

“Anything to drink?”

“Just water when you get around to it,” Lewis said. “I’ll let you know when we’re ready to order.”

As they discussed the menu, Hattie’s mind wandered. She wondered if it was a good time to raise a concern. It would be good to get her thoughts out there and have everyone put in their two cents.

Ten minutes later, with the food served and the comforting warmth of the meal filling the space, she decided to dive in.

“Lewis, I’ve been thinking about Flynn Elwood,” Hattie glanced around the table and began cautiously. “And… well… I’m wondering if his death wasn’t an accident.”

Lewis stopped chewing; his fork suspended mid-air. He set it down slowly, took a sip of water, and swallowed. “Why would you think that?”

“Well, I went online and searched—”

Muriel blinked hard. “Hattie, why didn’t you say something?”

Hattie shrugged. “Well, no one seemed to think otherwise. Anyway, I wondered how the gentleman could have been found so far from home. I remember that night—it was awful. And it wasn’t my imagination. I looked up the weather reports. They said, with the thirty-mile-per-hour winds, the wind chill was minus five degrees. Now, under those conditions, frostbite hits in ten minutes. Hypothermia within an hour, tops. And that’s if you’re dressed for it. No one survives long enough to walk four miles through snow that deep, in that cold, with wind like that cutting through you.”

Cartney spoke up, tapping her fork against her plate thoughtfully. “Maybe he began walking before the snow hit, then got confused.”

“Yes, that’s possible.”

“What a shame,” Muriel said softly, stirring her soup without eating. “Sounds like a perfect storm.”

“Perfect storm?” Hattie asked. “In what way?”

Muriel shrugged. “It’s just an odd situation that caused someone’s death. Too bad no one saw him. Maybe they could’ve helped. But as I recall, the snow began earlier in the day, and the thruway was closed by evening. It was a mess.”

Hattie nodded slowly. “Maybe it was a perfect storm for another reason.”

Lewis’s interest seemed piqued. He leaned in slightly, shadows accentuating the lines on his face. “And what reason could that be?”

“Well, the obvious. The gentleman had means. Maybe someone was waiting for the right time to make his passing an accident.”

Lewis leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table, his gaze sharp. “You’re not alone in that thought, Hattie. I’ve been chewing on it myself.”

Muriel’s eyes widened, her spoon pausing mid-air. “You think he was murdered too?”

“I don’t know for sure,” Lewis said. “But the more I look into it, the more it feels off. The storm was bad, sure, but four miles? In those conditions? It doesn’t make sense.”

Hattie nodded, her heart beating faster, grateful he was on the same page. “Exactly. He couldn’t have walked that far in those temperatures without collapsing.”

“And even if he could,” Lewis added, “why would he? Flynn was a recluse. The man barely left his house in good weather, let alone a freak snowstorm.”

Muriel set down her spoon with a soft clink, her face pale. “So, if he didn’t walk there himself… someone must have moved him.”

Cartney straightened up. “What’s the motive, though? Who benefits?”

Hattie nodded. “The property is worth a pretty penny. I looked it up. About $5 million.”

Lewis nodded. “And that may be the starting point. The property could be worth $8 million or more if restored. Developers are crawling over me, demanding I get the estate settled. They want the land, the mansion, everything.”

“Wait,” Muriel said, her brow furrowing. “Why are they coming to you?”

“I’m the one handling the estate, and since Flynn didn’t leave a will, I’m stuck managing it while the courts figure out who gets what. And in the meantime, every developer and preservationist in Buffalo is breathing down my neck.”

Hattie’s stomach tightened. The clatter of a dropped fork from another table made her flinch. “That’s a lot of money on the line. Enough to make someone desperate.”

“Exactly,” Lewis said. “Flynn didn’t have family, no one to fight for him. He was sitting on a gold mine.”

“So you think someone killed him to get the property?” Muriel asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

Lewis hesitated, then nodded. “I wouldn’t rule it out. The timing, the storm, the fact that he was found so far from the mansion—it all feels too convenient. But proving it? That’s another story. The coroner said he died from exposure, and that’s tough to refute.”

“Still, it makes sense,” said Cartney. “If someone wanted the mansion and Flynn was in the way, a snowstorm’s the perfect cover.”

“Exactly,” Hattie said. “But who? A developer? Someone with a personal grudge? Or maybe someone we haven’t even thought of yet?”

Lewis leaned back in his chair, his face weary, his fingers absently tracing the rim of his glass. “That’s the million-dollar question. And while we’re asking it, I’m stuck dealing with all these vultures circling the property. The pressure’s getting to me, I won’t lie.”

Hattie suddenly had a thought. An uncomfortable thought. “Lewis, if Flynn was murdered for money, you probably have already spoken with the person.”

He shook his head as if trying to dispel the idea. “That may be true. But who? I have a list of about fifty people that’s still growing.”

The three women exchanged glances. Cartney firmly placed her hand on the table, her voice steady and determined. “We’ll get to the bottom of this. ‘One for all and all for one.’”

Lewis, Hattie, and Muriel placed their hands on hers, repeating the phrase in unison, their voices low but filled with resolve.

As their hands rested together, Hattie felt a flicker of both warmth and dread. They were in this together, but she now wondered if the answers they sought might be darker than any of them were prepared to face.


Chapter 9: Howie and Horatio

Howie brought groceries home to his mother.

“Howie, you must let me give you money for these things.”

“Right, Ma.”

On the table sat a half gallon of milk, two jars of jam, a dozen eggs, a rotisserie chicken, five cans of soup, butter, a frozen raspberry pie, a coffee cake, a loaf of bread, and three blocks of frozen squash.

“You didn’t mention coffee or tea. Have you checked to see if you have enough?”

Hattie brushed him aside. “More than enough. Thank you. Now, let’s dig into the coffee cake. We’ll sit in the living room so you can tell me everything—spare nothing.”

Her son gave a kind smile. “As usual, there’s little to say or spare.”

“Now, Howie, how is that possible?”

“I don’t know, Ma.”

Hattie reached for the plates and coffee cups. She still worried about Howie and how he managed. She thought of Orin—her late husband—and a little voice inside said, he’s fine. Yes, of course, he is.

Once settled into the living room, Hattie took a sip of coffee. It was a nice change from tea, and the coffee cake melted in her mouth. She settled back. “Mmm. Delicious. So, how’s work?”

He shrugged. “Okay, I guess. Nothing new.”

“That’s nice.”

“And Meowzer?”

His face lit up. “Great.” He looked around the room. “And how’s Lucy?”

Hattie smiled. “A stinker, of course. Got into the toilet paper—clawed it to shreds.” She said aloud, “Luceee, where’s my kittee?” In seconds, the cat jumped onto the couch, sat an arm’s length from her, and meowed. “I’m so happy you have Meowzer. Cats—aren’t they wonderful company?”

He nodded. “Ma, enough about me. Are you behaving yourself?”

“Me? Of course.”

“No more jobs with Muriel and Cartney?”

Hattie knew this could come up one way or another. She had to mention it before he found out from someone else. “Actually, yes. Something quite unusual and interesting—we’re on a treasure hunt for Muriel’s boyfriend, Lewis Lewis.”

His brows furrowed. “Can you be more specific?”

“A friend of Lewis’s passed away, and we are going through the gentleman’s belongings to see if we can find a will or other supporting documents to help him settle the estate.”

“How did he die?” Howie asked, a flicker of curiosity in his eyes.

Hattie kept her expression steady. “It was accidental. He passed during that freak snowstorm we had last month. The poor man lived alone, and no one realized until after the storm cleared.”

Howie nodded. “That’s tough.”

“Yes, very sad,” Hattie said, steering the conversation back to safer ground. “Anyway, the man lived in a mansion downtown, and the place is quite remarkable—a time capsule from Victorian times. The main problem is that the poor fellow was a hoarder, and some rooms must be gone through.”

Howie put down his coffee. “Where is this place?”

For a moment, Hattie wondered if he didn’t believe her—such a silly thought. Hattie never really lied. “Over on Church—”

He interrupted. “The Elwood Mansion?”

“Yes. How do you know?”

“It’s a landmark.” He leaned into his chair and grinned. “Maybe I can visit you during my lunch hour?”

“Visit?”

“Just a quick one. I’ve never been inside. Would that be okay?”

“Well, sure. We don’t have a schedule, but I can call you when we’re there.”

“I’d like that.”

“Consider it done!”

They finished their coffee and chatted about everyday things—work, the weather, plans for the week. Eventually, Howie stood to leave, quickly hugging Hattie before heading out the door.

With Howie gone, Hattie wondered if he was curious about the place or curious about her and whether she was telling the truth. She tried never to lie, at least about important matters.  She went to her purse and pulled out the card Bubba had given her. Finding it, she went to get her phone. While she never purposefully lied, she could be accused of being sneaky. Sometimes, one had to be.

Before dialing, she glanced at Orin’s picture—a cherished memento of her late husband—and felt encouraged to go right ahead. She punched in H’s number.

“Yep,” came a curt man’s voice.

“Hello. My name is Hattie. Bubba Gumshoe gave me your number.”

No response.

“I’m looking for Horatio.”

No response.

Hattie waited to see if he disconnected. “Are you there?”

“Yeah. Sorry. The damn dog is tossing his breakfast. I gotta let him out.”

“Okay. Sure.” Hattie listened carefully to his heavy step and the dog’s scratching paws on the floor. Suddenly, a door burst open. “Specks! Don’t come back until you’re sorry!” And the door slammed shut. Hattie smiled. Another pet owner!

“So what can I do for you?”

“Well, I’m looking for something to protect myself with.”

“Something? That covers a lot of ground. “Can you be more specific?”

Hattie hesitated. Was this a good idea? “I was thinking of a… gun. Not a big gun or anything like that—just something small that I can put in my purse.”

“I see. I need to ask you a question.”

“Of course.”

“What does it look like?”

“The gun?”

“Yes. The gun.”

Hattie got the sense the man was fishing for details. “I’m not sure wh—”

He interrupted, repeating, “What’s it look like?”

Hattie’s mind raced. “Yes, yes. Give me a second…” Suddenly, she got it. “It looks like Idaho.”

“Good answer,” he said dryly. “I understand you are looking for one for yourself and a friend.”

“Yes.”

“I only have one. And I only do business with one person at a time. So, who would this be for?”

Hattie went into logic mode. If she didn’t get one, Muriel wouldn’t want one either. On the other hand, if Hattie got it for herself and Muriel still wanted one, she could give her hers. “It’s for me.”

“Okay. I want to meet you. There’s a restaurant around the corner from your house. My House? Can you meet me there at three tomorrow?”

“I… um…”

“You wanna cancel?”

“No. But how do you know where I live?”

“I like numbers.”

Hattie didn’t have a clue what that was supposed to mean.

“I’ll see you then.” And the line disconnected.

Hattie stared at her phone. Was she up for this guy? She’d have to think about it.


Chapter 10: The Gun

As the time got closer to three, Hattie had changed her mind too many times to count. And there were other problems. Who was this guy? What did he look like? And could the gun he was carrying be locked and loaded?

She thought it was ironic to be shot by some madman for a gun she wanted to buy for safety. Still, while it was a sketchy situation, there was one redeeming aspect—they were meeting in a public place where people knew her. And she had to admit, there was a level of excitement. But then again, at her age, with so much adrenaline pumping through her system, would she croak before she even got there?

She glanced over to Orin’s picture. “What do you say? Yay or nay?” All that came to mind was silly girl. Shaking her head, she muttered aloud, “Not helpful.”

At the door to Meg’s, Hattie squared her shoulders, reached for the pull, and entered. She scanned the room for a man sitting alone. Two were at the counter, and one at a far table with a service dog. No one seemed interested or gave her a passing glance. Maybe she was too early.

“Hey, Hattie, nice to see you!” called Susie, the ever-cheerful server, cook, and part-owner.

Hattie waved. “You still work here?”

Susie chuckled. “I tried to quit, but I wouldn’t let myself... Waiting for Muriel?”

“Not today. I’m meeting someone. I may be a little early.”

“Take a seat. I’ll keep an eye out. Want some tea?”

“Yes, that would be lovely.”

“Okey, dokey.”

Hattie settled at a table by the window with a clear view of the parking lot. If he didn’t show, it just wasn’t meant to be. On the plus side, she’d forgotten how nice it was to see people bustling around. Meg’s was in a small plaza with a fair amount of activity. A new bread shop had opened—maybe after her tea, she’d head over and pick up a loaf. Yes, capital idea.

As she scanned the restaurant again, the gray-haired man at the far table with the dog was heading out. Unlike other service dogs, this one was quite hefty, with distinctive black patches around both eyes. As he approached her table, she said, “What a marvelous-looking dog. What’s his name?”

“Why, thank you. His name is Specks, short for spectacles.”

Hattie didn’t skip a beat. “I’m having tea. Would you care to join me?”

He slid into the chair opposite her. “Don’t mind if I do.”

Horatio was an ordinary older man, grayed and wrinkled—except for one thing. As he looked at her, his clear blue eyes were piercing. When Susie approached, he asked for another cup of coffee.

“May keep you up at night,” she teased.

He offered an easy smile. “I can sleep when I’m dead.” Then he winked.

“I hear ya,” Susie said, knocking lightly on the table. “Be back in a sec.”

After some pleasantries and Susie set up tea and coffee, Horatio reached into his pocket, pulled out a folded sheet of paper, and scooted it toward Hattie. “For your eyes only,” he said.

Hattie nodded, running her fingers along the creased edge. The image was grainy and a bit blurred but unmistakable—a small, classic derringer.

Raising an eyebrow, she asked, “So, this is it?”

Horatio took a sip of his coffee. “That’s her. She’s in my car, locked up safe.”

“It’s smaller than I expected.”

“That’s why people like it,” he said. “Easy to carry. Easy to hide. Not so easy to aim, though, if you don’t know what you’re doing.”

Hattie studied the image again. “Is it loaded?”

Horatio shook his head. “I wouldn’t be that reckless. But it can be in seconds.” He leaned forward. “Before we go any further, Hattie, I need to know why you want this gun?”

She took a breath and chose to be general. “It’s for peace of mind. I live alone, and the world isn’t as friendly as it used to be. A gun seems... practical.”

Horatio nodded slowly as if weighing her words. “I get that. But owning a gun—especially carrying one—changes things. It’s not just an object. It’s a responsibility. And if you ever pull it, you’d better be damn sure you know what you’re doing because there’s no going back.”

Meeting his gaze steadily, Hattie replied, “Yes. It’s been a difficult decision.”

After a moment’s pause, Horatio continued, “Alright. This gun has two shots, no safety, and a short barrel. It’s built for close range—no warning shots.”

She tilted her head. “Why do you have it?”

“Let’s just say I picked it up at an estate sale without thinking too much about the legalities.”

Hattie frowned. “Meaning?”

“Meaning, technically, I can’t just hand it over to you. There’s paperwork—and a background check. That’s why these deals usually happen off the books.”

Hattie exhaled sharply. “So, what now? Are you backing out?”

Horatio looked at her for a long moment before shaking his head. “Not backing out. I want to make sure you understand what you’re getting into.” He glanced toward the parking lot. “Come on. Let’s take a look at her before we make any decisions.”

Hattie hesitated, then glanced out the window. It was now or never. “Alright,” she said, reaching for her wallet and laying down a ten-dollar bill. “Let’s go.”

Horatio pushed himself up from the chair and grabbed Specks’ lead. “Follow me.”

Outside, the air was crisp, and the smell of fresh bread wafted from the bakery. Horatio led her to an older sedan parked near the end of the lot. He opened the passenger-side door, reached into the glove compartment, and carefully removed a small, cloth-wrapped bundle.

He unwrapped it deliberately, revealing the derringer resting in the center. Beside it sat a single bullet.

Hattie leaned in for a better look. “It’s in good shape,” she observed.

“Yeah,” Horatio said. “Clean. No rust. The action’s smooth, but as I said—no safety. If you ever need to use it, you must know what you’re doing.” He picked it up, checked the chamber, and handed it to her. “Go ahead.”

She took it, surprised at how light it felt. The pearl grip was cool against her palm, the barrel short—barely more than a few inches. “Fits nice in my hand,” she said.

“That’s the appeal,” Horatio explained. “But like I told you inside, it’s a close-range weapon. There is no stopping power at a distance. And with only two shots, you have to make them count.”

Hattie nodded, running her fingers along the barrel. “You’ve been around guns a while, haven’t you?”

“A while,” he admitted. “I had a few in the military. I kept one after my wife passed. Never had to use it, thank God.”

She looked up at him. “What happened to that gun?”

Horatio shrugged. “Sold it to someone who needed it more than I did.” He gestured to the pistol in her hand. “If you’re serious about this, Hattie, you must do it correctly. Get a permit. Take a safety course. Carrying a gun without a permit—especially one you didn’t buy through proper channels—could land you in a world of trouble.”

Hattie exhaled, feeling the weight of his words. “I understand.”

“Good.” He pointed to the bullet. “That stays separate for now. If you decide to load it, that’s on you. But I’d rather you get trained first.”

Hattie set the gun back on the cloth. “So, how much do I owe you?”

Horatio scoffed. “Nothing.”

She frowned. “Come on, Horatio. You paid for it.”

“That doesn’t mean you have to,” he said firmly. “This isn’t a sale, Hattie. It’s me making sure a friend is prepared if she needs to be.”

Crossing her arms, she replied, “That’s ridiculous. I don’t take charity.”

“Then don’t think of it as charity,” he said. “Think of it as a favor you’ll pay forward, not back.”

Hattie studied him, trying to gauge his resolve. It was clear he wasn’t budging.

She sighed, shaking her head. “You’re a stubborn old man, you know that?”

Horatio grinned. “Takes one to know one.”

“Birds of a feather?”

He nodded.

She wrapped the gun carefully. “Alright. But if I ever get the chance to return the favor, I will.”

“I don’t doubt it.”

As she tucked the bundle into her purse and walked off, she couldn’t shake the feeling that this moment had just set something in motion.

“Orin,” she whispered beneath her breath, “stop scaring me.”


Chapter 11: The Kitchen

As planned, with the start of a new week, the foursome—Hattie, Muriel, Cartney, and Lewis—headed down the hall and entered the kitchen.

From Hattie’s quick assessment, the kitchen had none of the Victorian charm found in the rest of the house. Good news: it had been updated; bad news: about sixty years ago. Hattie smiled. What had once been a sleek, state-of-the-art kitchen when she was in high school now carried the wear and tear of decades. Had she aged like the kitchen? Hattie mused with a wry smile. Probably.

“My God, this place makes my teeth ache. So sugary, sweet, and pudgy,” Muriel laughed. “Look at that refrigerator and stove. Kinda cute, but seriously—PINK?”

“It matches the floor,” Lewis said kindly.

Cartney glanced at the checkered black and pink tiles. “A lot of people liked this style.”

“Better remembered than experienced,” Muriel replied. “When I was a kid and wore shorts, my legs would stick to those vinyl seats.”

Hattie thought that while the style had been all the rage in the fifties, the chrome appliances now seemed very dated and weathered. The bulky refrigerator, rounded at the edges, bore a dull, scratched surface from years of use. Unfortunately, the original tall, elegant mullioned windows spilled natural light across the room, further accentuating the dinged doors and rusted edges of the metal cabinetry where the finish had chipped away.

Lewis walked across the room. “The crew came in over the weekend and did another stellar job cleaning.” He began pulling open the cupboard doors and sliding open the drawers. “Now we can focus on our treasure expedition.” Stepping back, he continued, “The cupboards are full, as are the drawers. Maybe each of you can take a section, remove all the contents, and either bag or box them. Bags go for the trash; boxed items will be taken to the Goodwill. Any questions?”

Cartney walked over to a drawer, reached for a pair of pliers, and held them up. “To bag or to box?”

“Judgment call, I’d say. Nice for resale, but how many pliers does anyone really need? Use your discretion—and if there’s anything you want, assuming there aren’t shares for Coca-Cola, please help yourselves. I trust you ladies implicitly to do the right thing.” He moved over to two closed doors and opened one. “Here’s a bathroom. It’s just for your convenience, with nothing to do in there.” He nudged open a partially closed door. “And here’s the pantry. There are a lot of odd items in here. Box any non-expired cans and perishables for Mike to take to a shelter; otherwise, follow the same rules for boxing and bagging. Any questions?”

Cartney shrugged. “Sounds good.” Hattie and Muriel nodded.

“Call me at any time,” Lewis continued. “I’ve given Muriel a key to the front door. I want you to work as a three-person team during the day only. No one is to come here alone or with just one other person. This neighborhood isn’t the best, and there’s no need to answer the doorbell. I’ve put a notice on the door with my number in case anyone wants to contact me.” He glanced at his watch. “Mike should be here any minute. I’ll introduce you, then head back to the office.”

Hattie had been wanting to ask a question. She raised her hand.

“Yes, Hattie?” Lewis prompted with a smile.

“Do you want us here on specific days?” she inquired.

“No, only on the days when you can all make it. You also set your hours—work for as long as you like. Just keep track, as usual.”

A distant door opened and closed. Hattie turned toward the hall, curious to see Mike Grady.

Cartney asked, “So there’s no deadline for when this should be done?”

“I’d like to say within a month, but settling this estate might take a year.” He called out, “Mike, we’re in the kitchen.”

Suddenly, a man appeared in the doorway, wiping his hands on a rag as if he’d just finished working on a car. He was tall but slightly stooped, with a wiry frame that spoke of years of hard labor. His dark hair, streaked with gray, curled slightly at the edges of his cap, and deep lines on his face revealed a life of long days and tough breaks.

“Sorry, it took me a minute to get in—the door sticks,” he said in a gravelly yet kind voice. His sharp eyes scanned the group with curiosity before settling on Lewis. “These your crew?” he asked.

Lewis nodded. “Ladies, this is Mike Grady. He’s handling the hauling.”

Mike nodded toward the group, his expression unreadable. “Nice to meet you. Just tell me where the stuff’s going, and I’ll take care of it.”

Hattie studied him for a moment. He wasn’t particularly imposing, except for his work shirt rolled up at the sleeves to reveal strong forearms.

Never one to hold back, Muriel broke the silence. “So, Mike, you’ve done this kind of thing before?”

He smirked. “You mean hauling off the remnants of other people’s lives? Yeah.” Glancing around and rubbing his jaw, he added, “This one’s got history.”

Hattie noted how his gaze lingered on the pink appliances, a faint smile tugging at his lips.

“Well,” Lewis said, clearing his throat, “we’re glad to have you on board. These ladies will be sorting, so check in with them when you’re ready to start loading.”

Mike gave a short nod. “Will do. I’ll bring in the boxes and check on that stuck door.” Without further fanfare, he moved on, his boots dragging against the floor.

Hattie’s curiosity was piqued. How well did he know Flynn? Perhaps he could answer some of her lingering questions.


Chapter 12: The Drawer

While Mike unfolded the boxes, the others divided the work. Muriel took the pantry, and Hattie chose the drawers and lower cabinets. This left Cartney with the countertop and upper cupboards.

“If you can’t reach something or if it’s too heavy, let me know,” Mike said. “And if you want some coffee, I’ll run out.”

“Thanks,” said Hattie. “That’s very thoughtful.”

“Yeah. Always giving, never taking, that’s me.”

Hattie looked over to his deadpan face; there was a hint of a smile.

Muriel called out, “Mike, there may be mice in here. Can you give me a hand?” She poked her head into the kitchen. “Normally, when I see a mouse, I jump on something, but there’s nothing to jump onto.”

Cartney peeked at Hattie and said, “Gee, Mike, can you also handle damsels in distress?”

“My specialty,” he replied.

Muriel’s face beamed. “Great! Now, don’t worry, I won’t jump on you.”

Hattie shook her head. Was this the same woman who, just a year ago, had never been on a date? Lordy.

After discussing with Cartney how not to get in each other’s way, Hattie went to an end drawer, pulled it open, and found a stack of neatly folded kitchen towels. She nodded to herself. Good place to start. If these are clean, they can go to the Goodwill. As she grabbed the top towel, something underneath caught her eye. She pushed the cloth aside and froze. “Oh, my.”

Cartney, standing on a chair, looked down. “What the hell?”

Hattie opened the drawer wider when suddenly the drawer slipped out from beneath the counter, spilling piles of cash all over the floor. Cartney jumped down. “It’s a mother lode!”

The two stood in shock as Muriel and Mike joined them.

Muriel crossed her arms and tilted her head. “Well, shouldn’t we count it?”

Cartney shot her a look. “Why? You thinking of splitting it?”

Muriel scoffed. “Of course not. But if we’re going to tell Lewis, we should at least know how much is here.”

Hattie agreed. “She’s got a point.”

Mike grabbed an empty box and set it on the counter. “Fine. Let’s go.”

They divided the stacks, each taking a pile. The bills were mostly twenties, fifties, and hundreds, bundled neatly with rubber bands.

Minutes passed with the sound of rustling paper as they counted.

As each person finished, Mike added up their totals. “That brings us to—” he paused, “—fifty-four thousand, six hundred and twenty dollars.”

Cartney gave a low whistle. “Over a half a hundred grand, sitting in a kitchen drawer.”

Muriel pressed her lips together. “Well, I guess we better let Lewis know.”

Hattie sighed. “Yeah. He’s not going to believe this.”

While waiting for Lewis to respond to Muriel’s call and text, they returned to work. Naturally, Hattie pulled out every drawer to see if more money was stashed away. There wasn’t. Instead, they all looked very much like her junk drawer at home.

Some items were set aside to be kept, like keys of all kinds and shapes. Other items—loose nuts, screws, bolts, hooks—had to be tossed into bags.

Then there was the weird stuff: a cheap ring, a broken compass, a pocket watch frozen at 2:17, a Rubik’s Cube, strawberry lip gloss, and an old political button that read I Like Ike.

Hattie turned the button over, wondering who had once pinned it to their coat, what rallies they had attended, and if they’d ever imagined their keepsake would end up buried in a cluttered drawer.

She laid the oddities on the table.

After Mike had filled the boxes and bags, he walked over to the table.

“Find anything interesting?” he asked.

“The keys for sure. Otherwise, looks like my own junk drawer.”

He glanced around the table when something caught his eye. “Hm.” He reached for the ring. “My daughter had one of these. It’s a mood ring. Changes colors.”

“I remember those. Maybe she’d like it.”

“We don’t see each other anymore.”

Hattie felt his sadness. “Oh. I’m sorry to hear that.”

He gave Hattie a vague nod while continuing to look over the stash.

“Feel free to take anything in this section. Lewis told us we could take any items headed for the garbage. No charge.”

“Thanks.”

Suddenly, Muriel’s phone rang. “It’s Lewis. I’ll put him on speaker… Hey...”

“Hey, yourself. What’s up?”

“We… um… found some stuff.”

“Great. What?”

Cartney spoke up. “Are you sitting down?”

“You guys are all on speaker? This can’t be good.”

Muriel took over. “Well, it’s not particularly bad—just kinda unexpected. Hattie, tell him.”

Hattie leaned toward the phone. “I opened a drawer and found some money.”

“Okay. That doesn’t sound like a problem. Just hang onto it until I see you guys again.”

“Lewis,” Muriel said, “we counted it. It’s a lot.”

“What? A couple of hundred?”

Muriel looked at the jotted-down number. “No, it’s fifty-four thousand, six hundred and twenty dollars.”

No response.

“Lewis, are you there?”

“Fuck! Don’t do anything. Wait there.”

* * *

Lewis slapped one stack of bills over another. “Shit,” he muttered. “This is a goddamn mess.”

Muriel frowned. “It’s cash, Lewis. Why are you freaking out?”

“Because I’m the executor, and cash like this is a nightmare. It has to be reported—all of it. If I screw that up, it’s on me. Fraud charges, audits, maybe years stuck in probate hell.”

Hattie blinked. “But it was in a drawer. Couldn’t it just be forgotten savings?”

“Doesn’t matter. The IRS doesn’t care where it came from. If it’s not documented, they assume someone’s hiding something and come after the person in charge. That’s me.”

Mike chuffed. “Damn.”

Lewis nodded grimly. “Yeah. Cash looks simple. But for an executor? It’s a landmine.”

“So… what do we do?” Muriel asked.

“We do nothing except handle this by the book. I need to document it, report it to the probate court, and determine if it legally belongs to the estate or was supposed to go to someone specific.”

Muriel shifted. “And if we don’t report it?”

Lewis gave her a hard look. “Then I risk losing my law license. I could be disbarred. That means no job, no career, no nothing.”

Silence fell over the group.

“Gee, Lewis,” Muriel said, “maybe it’s good we found it now. Wouldn’t it be worse if everything were settled and you had to backtrack?”

He looked at Muriel with kindly eyes. “Yes. I suppose so. I’m overreacting. I want this off my plate. I keep kicking myself for talking to the judge and assigning this to me.”

“You did the right thing,” Hattie said. “Flynn may have been eccentric, but he was your friend, and I’m sure he’d want you to take care of his matters.”

“Okay, I feel better,” said Lewis. “Mike, would you mind following me until I get to the bank? I have never carried this kind of money around.” He sauntered over to Muriel. “How about I stop over at your house for a drink—say, around six?”

Muriel’s face brightened. “I’d love that.”

“Okay, ladies. Let’s wrap it up and enjoy the rest of the day.”

As Hattie collected her coat and purse, her eyes fell on the remnants from one of the drawers. She looked more closely and saw that the mood ring, chapstick, and Rubik’s Cube were gone.


Chapter 13: Rootin’ Tootin’

Muriel let herself into Hattie’s house.

“Well, Lewis finally calmed down.” She plopped into a chair. “It took two double whiskeys and three hours of me convincing him of the bright side.”

“Bright side?”

“Yes. He has me as his girlfriend and my undying support and love. Blah, blah, blah.”

Hattie laughed. “Muriel, you almost sounded romantic until the blah, blah part.”

Her friend winked. “It’s a gift. Anyway, I never saw him so upset.” Suddenly, her face darkened. “After he left, I couldn’t sleep. Hattie, what would I ever do without him?”

Hattie poured two cups of coffee, unsure of what to say. Losing someone was hard—very hard.

“Anyway, you know how I’ve been upset about whatever’s going on with him. Now, I don’t give a rat’s dupa if he likes someone else, as long as we stay friends. Full stop. And once I realized that, my concerns buzzed the bees right out of my bonnet. Sayonara.”

“Muriel, you got it! If everyone led from their heart, we’d all avoid a ton of misery.”

“I suppose.” She dug into her purse. “So, I baked some chocolate chip cookies. Let’s have some coffee. They’re great when you dunk them.”

“Sure,” Hattie said. “I love your recipe.”

“Yeah. Add enough butter to any mix, and magic happens… We didn’t get a chance to talk yesterday. Anything new?”

Of course, there was. Hattie was now the proud owner of a derringer. “Well… um…”

Muriel’s eyes narrowed. “Hmm. Hattie Moon, have you been a bad girl?”

“Well, kinda, sorta, but not really.”

“What’s that supposed to mean? Spit it out, girl.”

Hattie wasn’t sure how Muriel would take the news. They usually did everything together. “Now, I don’t want you to get upset.”

“Hattie, you’ve never upset me, not one single iota. You’re the best friend I’ve ever had.”

Hattie took a sip of coffee. There was no time like the present. She straightened. “Okay, I did something wild… I should have called you, but I knew I could handle it. Besides, he only had one, and he only liked dealing with a single buyer at a time. I didn’t want to lose the opportunity. And, ultimately, it went fairly smoothly—”

Muriel interrupted. “Hattie, what are you talking about?”

There was no sense beating around the bush. “I got a gun.”

Disbelief crept over Muriel’s face. “Huh? You’re kidding. You bought a gun from Bubba’s friend? What? Without me? WITHOUT ANYONE? What the hell! Hattie Moon, was that wise?”

Hattie suddenly felt proud. “It does sound dangerous, doesn’t it? Imagine little old me going to meet a stranger to buy an illegal firearm… Kinda badass, don’t you think?”

Muriel sat stunned; a cookie held midair. “Okay, I want to hear everything. Leave nothing out.”

Hattie wondered if she should make the story sound even more badass. Then she decided to tell it straight. “We met at Meg’s. You know, the diner around the corner—”

“When was this?”

“The day before yesterday.”

“What time?”

“At three.”

“How did you know what he looked like?”

“I didn’t.”

“He must have described himself.”

“No. We talked on the phone, and then he said he wanted to meet me around the block from my house.”

“Hattie, you told him where you lived??!”

“No, I would never do that.”

“Well, so how did he know?”

Hattie gave a nervous laugh. “He said he already knew.”

Her friend’s face screwed up. Hattie rushed on. “Yes, it was a shock. I asked him how he knew my address, and he said he ‘liked numbers.’”

“Numbers? What was that supposed to mean?”

Hattie shrugged. “I don’t know… Since we were meeting at Meg’s, I figured it was safe enough.”

Muriel nodded. “So, did he say what he looked like?”

Hattie shook her head.

“How were you going to recognize him?”

“Well, he’d be alone, and from our phone conversation, he sounded like an older gentleman.”

Muriel shook her head ever so slightly. “Go on.”

“Anyway, there were three single men there—two at the counter and one at a far table with a service dog. Nobody seemed interested in me. When Meg came over, I ordered some tea and decided if no one showed up, I’d leave… So I’m sitting there, and the guy with the dog got up to head out. It was an unusual service dog. Not like a shepherd or a lab. The dog was large, with a squarish face and two black circles around its eyes.”

Muriel sighed. “Hattie, that sounds like a pit bull, and I doubt it was a service dog—that’s an attack dog!”

“Huh? Seriously? He seemed docile… Anyway, I commented on the dog’s eyes, and he told me its name was Specks, for spectacles. That’s when I knew he was Horatio because, on the phone, he’d mentioned his dog named Specks.”

Muriel put out her hand. “Hattie, stop. You’re telling me you bought a gun at Meg’s on a Sunday afternoon from a stranger with a pit bull that’s supposedly a service dog?”

Hattie wasn’t sure what the big problem was. “Yes. That’s right.”

“Hattie, kinda gangsta, don’t you think?”

“Gangsta. What’s that?”

“Gangster. You know… on the wrong side of the law.”

“Horatio? But he goes to estate sales.”

Muriel threw up her hands. “Yes, because obviously, if he’s into old junk, he’s perfectly trustworthy!”

“Now, Muriel…”

“Okay, sorry… So you realized it was him, then what?”

“I asked him to sit down, which he did. Then Meg came over, and he ordered a coffee. Then…um.”

Muriel’s eyes turned suspicious.

“He reached into his pocket and pulled out a piece of paper.”

Muriel blinked hard.

“Naturally, I was curious. He slid it over to me… it was a picture of a bullet and a derringer. The gun looked like those in old movies—very cute, with a pearly handle. He wanted me to see a picture first, and if I was still interested, I could go to his car and look at the real thing.”

Muriel rubbed her forehead. “Please tell me you didn’t get into his car.”

“Huh? How else was I going to see it?”

“Oh, Hattie. Think about it: he’s a stranger, and you’re getting into his car, where he keeps a gun and a pit bull.”

Hattie looked away. “Well, since you put it that way…”

“So what happened?”

“Nothing much. He showed me the gun and told me to take the safety courses and go through the permit and registration processes.”

Muriel sighed. “At least that’s responsible. But what about the bullet?”

“He said that if I ever want to load a gun, I should think hard about what could happen and be ready to pay the consequences.”

“Hmm… Maybe the guy’s legit… How much did he charge you?”

“Not a penny. He wouldn’t take anything. I tried.”

Muriel bit the inside of her cheek, clearly thinking hard. Hattie asked, “Muriel, what are you thinking?”

“Are you going to see him again?”

“No. Why would I?”

“I don’t know… So where’s this gun?”

“In the buffet. I’ll get it, and we can go online to see how it works.”

“Sounds like a plan.”

* * *

Ten minutes later, the ladies were settled at the dining room table. Hattie’s laptop was open, and the gun—still wrapped in cloth—lay between them.

“Ready?”

Muriel’s eyes gleamed. “Ready!”

Hattie carefully unwrapped it. Muriel leaned over. “OMG, is this adorbz or what? Can I hold it?” she asked, reaching and then pausing. It’s not loaded, right?”

“I don’t think so. I mean, I didn’t put the bullet in. Just in case, we shouldn’t point it at each other.”

“Yeah, that’s a plan.”

Muriel turned the cloth so the gun was pointed at the wall. “Okay… Should I use my right or left hand?”

Hattie shrugged. “I don’t think it matters.”

After a deep breath, Muriel picked up the gun. It looked even smaller in her large hand. “Is this for real?” She put her finger on the trigger. “It barely fits.”

“Hmm. Maybe I got a small size.”

“Oh, it should be fine for you. My fingers are sausages—like everything else on my body. Gosh darn it.”

“Don’t start that.”

“Start what?”

“Putting yourself down.”

Muriel gave a little shrug.

“I know,” said Hattie. “Let’s go online and learn how to load this.”

Moments later, Hattie typed: how to load a double-barrel derringer.

Muriel leaned over Hattie’s shoulder, squinting. “You sure we should be looking this up? Feels like the kind of thing that lands you on a government watchlist.”

“Good point. Let’s try this.” She typed: educational video on antique pocket pistols.

Muriel snorted. “Oh, yeah. That’s much better. Real subtle.”

Hattie ignored her and clicked through a few videos. Most were hosted by suspiciously enthusiastic collectors—one of whom had too many missing fingers.

Muriel winced. “Uh, maybe not that guy. He’s got, like, a three-finger credibility issue.”

Hattie scrolled until a title caught her eye:

DON’T SHOOT YOURSELF WHILE LOADING A DERRINGER.

Muriel’s eyes widened. “That seems… important.”

Hattie clicked.

A cheerful instructor in a cowboy hat appeared on-screen. “Folks, if you don’t half-cock the hammer before loading your derringer, you might just blow off your leg.”

Both women straightened.

The video cut to a slow-motion reenactment of a melon being obliterated.

Muriel slapped Hattie’s arm. “DID YOU SEE THAT?”

Hattie swallowed hard and nodded. “Okay. Half-cock. Very important.”

The cowboy continued, “Remember, never drop a bullet in without half-cocking the hammer first, or BOOM—”

They both flinched.

Muriel held up her hands. “Yeah, you know what? Maybe I don’t need a gun after all.”

Hattie looked at the bullet and made a decision. “And I’m not going to load this gun.”

Muriel exhaled dramatically. “I second that motion.”

“It seemed like a cool idea, but I guess I hadn’t thought it through… I can still carry it, right?”

“No clue.”

“What harm could that be?”

“None that I know of.”

* * *

After Muriel left, Hattie shut the laptop. While putting the pistol away, she noticed her reflection in the china cabinet.

Well now.

Curious, she turned toward the buffet mirror and raised the derringer. Click.

She pretended to shoot herself square in the chest. Click.

She angled the gun to her side, hip cocked like an old-school gunslinger. Click.

This was fun.

She widened her stance, struck a dramatic pose, and aimed at her reflection again. Click. Click.

Faster now—Click-click-click-click-click!

She spun. Click!

Ducked. Click!

She pivoted, threw in a finger gun for flair, and became a full-action hero. Suddenly, she stopped, derringer still raised. Her heart raced. Her hands tingled. She grinned.

“Well, I’ll be damned,” she whispered to herself. “I’m not badass. I am a badass.”


Chapter 14: Father John

The crew returned to the mansion and picked up where they had left off. Soon, the counters were stacked with old cookware, faded linens, and forgotten knickknacks.

Stooped on the floor, pulling out a slew of cast-iron pans, Cartney wondered aloud, “After finding all that money, I’m wondering how much more could be lying around.”

Muriel called out from the pantry. “Let’s just keep it. Lewis may lose another gasket.”

Cartney exchanged a glance with Hattie.

Muriel poked her head out. “Just kidding.”

Hattie wiped her hands on a rag and surveyed the room. “What’s next?”

Muriel gestured toward a row of cabinets. “We haven’t even opened those yet.”

Before anyone could move, a knock sounded on the back kitchen door.

They froze. Why would someone come to the back entrance? The rule was simple—tell them to go to the front door and call the number.

“I’ll take care of it,” Hattie said. “Who is it?”

A muffled voice replied, but she couldn’t make out the words.

“Go to the front door and call the number,” Hattie instructed, her voice firm.

There was a pause, and then the man knocked on one of the windows. He waved, “Hello there. I’m Father John, Flynn’s friend. I’ve spoken with Lewis. He said you guys would be here today.”

Hattie was surprised to see a priest. His crisp clerical collar stood out against the thick black coat. Beneath it, she could see the outline of a traditional cassock.

Cartney was first to whisper her opinion. “When it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it must be a duck.”

Yes, Hattie thought, he certainly looked like a priest. And since he knew Lewis’s name, he must have spoken with him.

“Better see what he wants,” Muriel piped in.

Moments later, Father John stomped on the kitchen floor and reached out. While shaking hands, he said, “I’m the parish priest over at St. Dominic’s. I’ve been friends with Flynn for over thirty years.”

After some pleasantries, Hattie said, “Sorry for your loss.”

“Well, he’s with the Lord now.” He made the sign of the cross. “So you’re going through his things. Monumental task, but I see you’ve made great progress.”

“It’s a room-by-room chore,” Hattie said. “Lewis has a bona fide cleaning crew come in first.”

“Yes,” said Muriel, “and then we have our aftercare guy who hauls things away. Do you know Mike Grady?”

“I do indeed. He was a great help to Flynn—an all-around Guy Friday. Whatever Flynn needed, whether it was a ride to the store or a hot water install, Grady was his man…” He looked around the room. “With a crew handling the cleaning and hauling, what’s left for you?” His tone was light, curious.

“Whatever we can find so Lewis can settle the estate.”

“Oh, yes. That makes sense. Flynn was in a bad way. Confused. Sad to see his decline.”

“Did you visit him often?” Hattie asked.

“Whenever I could. I’m just down the street. I often celebrated a short Mass with the Eucharist—some spiritual counseling and any other sacraments he wanted. That always seemed to bring him a sense of peace. Anyway, Lewis mentioned that you’ll be starting with the library next.”

Muriel nodded.

“So I was hoping I could have my atlas returned before it’s disposed of. It’s a heavy, leather-bound volume called the Stieler’s Handatlas, 10th Edition, 1944. It’s very thick. Do you mind if I take a quick look? I think it might be in the history section near the fireplace.”

The women exchanged glances. Muriel spoke up. “Of course,” she said. “No problem.” She turned to Cartney and Hattie. “Do any of you want to take a break?”

They all agreed and headed to the library.

Hattie entered the library, inhaling the familiar scent of old paper and polished wood. The room had an air of quiet dignity, though dust had settled thick in the corners. She felt the weight of what remained—Flynn’s life in hardcovers, paperbacks, and dog-eared pages.

Father John moved toward the fireplace, his steps unhurried, as if he belonged in this room. Maybe he did. Thirty years of friendship was no small thing. Hattie watched as he ran his hand along the spines, a quiet reverence in how he touched each book, pausing occasionally to read a title.

“It should be right here,” he murmured, crouching slightly. He pulled out a few books, peered behind them, then returned them to their places with a thoughtful frown.

Hattie watched him. He seemed genuinely puzzled. If this was some act, it was a subtle one.

“Flynn did have quite a collection,” Muriel said, her voice cutting through the stillness. She leaned against a side table, eyeing the shelves. “You could open a secondhand shop with all this.”

Father John chuckled softly. “Flynn never did anything halfway. He was a collector who valued history in all its forms. But he also had a habit of tucking things away—sometimes even from himself.” He shifted more books, his brows knitting together.

Hattie glanced at Cartney, who was now at the far shelves, running her hand along the spines. “You said you and Flynn were friends for thirty years?”

Father John straightened, nodding. “That’s right. We met when I was first assigned to St. Dominic’s. Flynn was already well-established in town, always willing to lend a hand to the parish. A private man, though. More so in his later years.” His expression darkened slightly. “It was hard watching him decline.”

“Did he ever mention hiding things?” Muriel asked. “Valuables, papers, money?”

Father John’s expression turned thoughtful. “Not outright. But he did have a habit of securing things in places he considered ‘safe.’ The trouble was that his memory wasn’t what it used to be. If he did hide something, it’s possible he forgot where.”

Cartney smirked. “Sounds like half the people I know.”

Father John chuckled and gave the space on the shelf one last look. “I could’ve sworn it was here. But no matter—I don’t want to take up any more of your time.”

“We’ll keep an eye out,” Muriel said. “If it turns up, we’ll set it aside for you.”

Cartney took out her phone. “If you like, we can take down your contact info and let you know.”

“Capital idea! It’s FJMC, all caps, at Gmail dot com. Oh yes, I forgot to mention that I have some of Flynn’s books at the rectory. I’ll make sure to bring them back.”

“Wonderful!” Muriel said.

Father John checked his watch. “My goodness, I’m running a bit late. Do you mind if I skedaddle? I’ll head out the way I came.”

“Certainly,” Muriel said.

As soon as his footsteps faded, she exhaled. “Well, that was something.”

Cartney crossed her arms. “Yeah. Do we think he just wanted that book or is there more to it?”

Hattie shook her head. “I don’t know. Something about the way he searched the shelves—it felt like he wasn’t just looking for the atlas. More like he was taking inventory.”

Muriel frowned. “I got that feeling too, but maybe it’s just because he spent so much time in this room with Flynn. Nostalgia can make people act funny.”

“Could be,” Cartney admitted. “But you know what’s bugging me? He said it was his atlas. How do we know that?”

Muriel raised an eyebrow. “He sounded pretty sure about it.”

“So?” Cartney shrugged. “That doesn’t mean it’s true. We don’t have a note from Flynn saying, ‘Hey, if Father John shows up asking for this book, it’s his.’ For all we know, it was Flynn’s, and the good father wants it for himself.”

Hattie considered that. “And if Flynn was as forgetful as everyone keeps saying, he might not have even remembered whether it was his.”

Muriel tilted her head. “Alright, fine. Let’s say there’s a chance it wasn’t his. What would a priest want with some old atlas so badly?”

Cartney pulled out her phone and tapped the screen. “That’s what I was wondering. Maybe it’s valuable.” After a few moments, she let out a low whistle. “Well, look at this. Depending on the condition, a Stieler’s Handatlas, 1944 edition, could go for anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.”

Muriel reared back. “What?”

“Yep,” Cartney said, holding up the phone. “And if it’s got annotations—even more.”

They exchanged glances.

Muriel exhaled. “Okay. So maybe we don’t just hand it over if we find it. At least not until we’re sure it belongs to him.”

Hattie nodded. “Agreed. We’ll tell Lewis about it, let him decide. If Father John is legit, he won’t mind waiting.”

“That’s fair,” Cartney said, slipping her phone back into her pocket. “But if he comes sniffing around again, I will watch him a little closer.”

Hattie couldn’t argue with that. Father John might be exactly who he said he was—an old friend, just looking to reclaim something that mattered to him. They would take it one step at a time.

The crew returned to the kitchen. Two hours later, they were done, with ten boxes and three bags to show for it.

“Grady should be called,” Cartney said.

Hattie agreed. “I’ll call the minute I’m home.”

As the three stood at the back door to leave, Hattie looked over the kitchen. It was no longer merely dated but more vintagey—cozy. The only oddity was that the drawer that had contained all the money was partially pulled out. Had she forgotten to close it? Silly girl. Of course.


Chapter 15: Carol, the YouTuber

Relaxing in the evening with a cup of tea and lingonberry toast (her dinner), Hattie went online and caught up with her favorite YouTuber, Carol, a seventy-five-year-old woman who lived in a car. Carol often said to anyone who asked that she wasn’t homeless; she was living within her means—specifically, Social Security.

Hattie clicked on the site and noticed she was three episodes behind. She read the titles and settled on Lonely? No. I’ve never felt more alive.

She reached for her tea. Before she could take a sip, her phone rang. She glanced at the screen: Horatio.

Pleasantly surprised, she smiled, paused the video, and answered without fanfare. “Are you calling to tell me you won the lottery?”

Horatio chuckled. “Not quite. Though, if I did, I’d split it with you.”

“Sure you would,” she said, shaking her head. “This is unexpected. If it’s not the lottery, are you checking to see if I’m still alive?”

“Well… I was thinking.” He hesitated, then cleared his throat. “About that little gun I gave you.”

Her smile faded. Where was this going? She shifted in her seat. “Uh-huh.”

“You still got it?”

“Of course.”

“You, uh… You haven’t put bullets in it, right?”

“Bullets? Didn’t you only give me one?”

He rephrased. “You haven’t put the bullet in it, have you?”

Hattie rolled her eyes. “Now, Horatio, do I look like some kind of...” She almost said idiot but changed her mind. “...badass that would carry around a loaded gun?”

He laughed. “It’s not a bridge too far. Just making sure. You know, things can get away from you. I found an old stash of jelly beans in my glove box the other day—probably from the Reagan administration.”

Hattie blinked. What do jelly beans have to do with bullets? The size? “Well, I promise not to accidentally load the gun with jelly beans if that’s what you suggest.”

Horatio chuckled again, then fell silent.

Hattie waited… and waited some more… Something was on his mind. “Horatio, did you just call to check on the gun?”

A long breath came through the line. Then he spoke. “No.”

She settled back. “Alright, then. What’s really on your mind?”

More silence. Then, finally: “I was wondering about something you said. I’m looking for advice—if you can spare it.”

“Advice? Do you mean words of wisdom or how to fry chicken? I’m afraid I’m not very good at either.”

“No, it’s nothing like that. It’s about your husband.”

Hattie blinked. “My husband?”

“Yeah…” He hesitated. “I mean, do you just… talk out loud? Or is it all in your head?”

She set her cup down. “Depends. Sometimes, I think things as though he can hear me. Other times, I say stuff out loud, like when I lose my glasses and figure he’s laughing at me.” She paused. “Why do you ask?”

More rustling on his end. “I want to talk to her. To my wife. But I don’t know how.”

Her chest tightened. She hadn’t expected this. His voice was different now—quieter, uncertain. She softened. “You miss her tonight,” she said gently.

“I do.” His voice was barely above a whisper. “I was going through some old things and had… this urge to tell her something. Nothing big. Just a little thing. And I realized… I don’t know how.”

Hattie felt the slightest ache. “Well, she’s not gone, Horatio. Not really. You can talk to her just like you talk to me.”

“But will she hear me?”

She smiled. “If you believe so. I can only say that talking with Orin has been a great comfort to me. At first, it seemed silly. It bothered my son, too. It still might. Not everyone understands. But the more you talk to your wife—in whatever way feels right—the more consolation you may find.”

A long silence stretched between them.

Finally, Horatio let out a breath. “Okay. But how?”

Hattie tried to remember when she first spoke to Orin.

Yes. It was a night after she’d sobbed for hours, feeling empty, hollow, desperate. When completely depleted, she screamed into the darkness, “HOW COULD YOU LEAVE ME?”

Of course, she hadn’t heard his voice then, but something did happen. At first, only silence answered. Then, a gentle creak from the old rocking chair across the room—the one he always sat in, the one she hadn’t been able to bring herself to move—swayed. Not by much, just the slightest shift, the kind the wind might cause.

Except there was no wind. The windows were shut. The air was still.

Her mind fought for a reason. Indeed, the house settled all the time. Wood contracted. Shadows played tricks. She knew this. But none of that explained the scent that suddenly filled the room—his scent. Faint but unmistakable: cedar and the pipe tobacco he’d given up years before.

Tears burned her eyes as she let out a shuddering breath. “Are you here?”

I’m here.

The words lingered in the air as though carried on a dream. She swallowed hard, pressing a trembling hand to her chest. “Orin?” she whispered.

No voice came this time, no whispered reassurance, but the chair rocked again—just once, deliberately. And Hattie knew.

She gathered her thoughts and turned her attention back to Horatio. “There’s no right or wrong way. Just talk to her. It can be about anything. Something on your mind, perhaps a memory or a question.” Her voice softened. “Tell her whatever you need to say. And if you listen real close, you may hear something—or see or sense something. At least, that’s how it works for me.”

Another pause. “Thanks, Hattie.”

“You’re quite welcome.”

After the call ended, Hattie set down her phone and resumed the video.

Carol’s voice filled the quiet room: “The truth is, when you carry people in your heart, you’re never really alone.”

A small smile tugged at Hattie’s lips. “Isn’t that the truth?” she murmured and took another bite of toast.


Chapter 16: Curiosities

A day later, they returned to empty the library. It was a monumental job.

“I don’t know, ladies,” Mike Grady said as he spun around the room, surveying the dusty bookshelves that lined the walls. “This is a huge haul.” He pointed along one row. “From my experience, one of these shelves can fill three or four boxes. Then there’s that rolltop desk with all its drawers—who knows what’s in there? That’s gonna take some real digging. And I’m gonna need more boxes. This is easily a two-day job.”

Cartney nodded. “I think we should pick a spot and get to work.”

Hattie decided to start somewhere at eye level and work downward. As she scanned the area, she noticed a round, glass-fronted box on the shelf. It looked like a wooden-framed porthole nestled between books. Intrigued, she walked over to investigate. Behind the glass were tiny shelves—reminiscent of one of those ornate shadow boxes they’d once bought online. “Muriel, come see this.”

“Well, well, what do we have here?” Muriel replied, stepping closer.

“Remember when we bought those shadow boxes online? It’s kinda like that,” Hattie said.

Muriel nodded. “I wonder what’s inside.”

Mike slipped in behind them. “That’s called a Victorian curiosity cabinet. I haven’t seen one this small, but since it looks like mahogany and has that wide fish-eye glass, it probably is. I wonder what’s inside?” He reached over and fiddled with a small knob. “It should turn… Yes. I think I’ve got it.”

The glass window swung open. Hattie craned her neck to see.

Mike continued, “Rich folks back in the day liked to collect oddities from their travels—natural specimens, strange artifacts, anything exotic or impressive. But if you notice a smell or see any mold, close the door immediately.”

“Why is that?” Cartney asked.

“Mold spores can be dangerous, especially if the cabinet holds dried biological specimens. Old taxidermy, mummified animals, or dried plants might carry mold. If stored in a damp place, those spores could be active and cause respiratory problems.”

Muriel squinted at the shelves. “You mean, like a health hazard?”

“Exactly. If anything looks fuzzy or smells musty, it’s best to be careful.”

Muriel exchanged a glance with Hattie. “Good to know. I’ll use the five-second rule to see what’s inside, then skedaddle. I won’t touch anything.”

Cartney sauntered over. “So what do we have here?”

An odd collection of objects lay on velvet-lined shelves—a scattering of tiny animal bones, a cluster of iridescent beetles pinned in a neat row, and a delicate bird’s nest.

Mike’s eyes lingered on the contents. He took a sharp breath.

Hattie noticed the change—like a fleeting shadow passing over him, quick yet unmistakable.

“What’s the matter, Mike?” Muriel asked.

“Nothing,” he replied too quickly. He stepped back, rubbing the back of his neck. “Dead things give me the creeps, that’s all. Always has. Some things aren’t meant to be on display. This is just wrong.”

Wrong. That word settled in Hattie’s mind. She tilted her head. Perhaps he made a valid point—maybe physical decay demonstrated moral decay as well.

Muriel spoke up. “Mike, I get it. For instance, when I look in the mirror and stare too long, my face seems to change—as if it isn’t even mine, if only for a second.”

“Yeah, well, that is weird,” he said with a playful shrug. “Still, ladies, if you don’t mind, this item goes into the trash.” Without further hesitation, he tossed the curiosity cabinet into a bag.

Hattie recalled a similar incident with Mike—a small, minor moment that had seemed insignificant yet now resonated with a familiar, uneasy feeling. How could someone who was open and friendly be so secretive about something seemingly trivial?

Her stomach tightened as that old discomfort crept back in. She searched her memory for the moment that felt just out of reach, on the tip of her tongue.

Something had happened in the kitchen. It was there—a mere wisp of a thought—before Cartney clapped her hands. “Well, that’s settled. Time to get to work.”

The moment passed. Mike had already moved on, stepping away from the discarded cabinet. But Hattie lingered a moment longer. She’d remember. She always did.


Chapter 17: Photographs

In the desk’s bottom drawer, Hattie hit the motherlode.

Photographs—hundreds of them—spilled across her lap, spanning a century. There were black-and-white snapshots, faded sepia images, and crisp Kodachrome prints. Some were barely the size of a calling card, while others were full 8x10 portraits exuding the stiff formality of professional photography. She shuffled through them, her fingers grazing the edges.

There was one huge problem—actually, several.

Who were these people? How was she supposed to sort out what mattered from what didn’t? Hattie turned a picture over, searching for a name, a date, or any identifying mark that might anchor the subject to a specific time or place. She checked several more—only brittle paper.

Maybe it was a fool’s errand. Perhaps pictures didn’t matter when everyone in them was dead.

“What should I do with these?” she murmured to herself.

Cartney leaned over and plucked one from the pile. “Well, now, this lady’s got some style—fox fur and pearls. Probably 1930s. She’s either rich or wants people to think she is.”

Muriel joined them, taking the photo and holding it at arm’s length. “Or she’s dead broke and spending her last dime looking respectable… that’s the thing about old pictures. You don’t know if you’re looking at someone at the height of fortune or on the edge of ruin. Time stops cold. Where’s the rest of the story?”

Hattie shrugged. “We may never know.”

If only she were an archivist or a historian—how would they deal with these? She imagined someone in a dust-covered office, carefully cataloging each image by scrutinizing tiny clues—a photographer’s stamp, the wear on the edges, the fashion, even the paper type—to date and place them.

Every picture tells a story, right? But how could she hear them when the voices were long gone?

She flipped through one pile and then another, her hands moving faster. Something felt… off. There was a gap, an absence she couldn’t quite name—until it hit her.

There were no children in the pictures.

Not one.

She slowed down, sorting carefully. Weddings, formal gatherings, candid snapshots in cars and on porches—all ages were represented except the young. No toddlers clutching toys, no gangly teens with awkward grins. And most noticeably, no Flynn.

“Wait a minute,” she murmured, “where’s Flynn?”

Cartney straightened. “You sure he’s not there? Maybe tucked in the background somewhere?”

She shook her head. “No. I’ve been through almost a hundred of these. He should be here. He was the last child in the family lineage, wasn’t he?”

Muriel frowned as she flipped through a handful of photos. “That’s… strange. You’d expect at least one baby picture. A kid on the front steps, at a birthday party—something.”

“Exactly. He grew up in this house. But you’d never know he existed if you only had these pictures.”

A silence settled among them until Cartney clapped her hands. “Hold on a second, Hattie. This is just one drawer. There are others. Maybe they’re arranged by years, and you haven’t gotten to them yet.”

Hattie blinked. Of course, the odds were that this wasn’t the entire collection; it was just a fraction of it.

Muriel nodded. “Good point. People organize things in ways that make sense to them, not us. Maybe these are the older generations, and Flynn’s pictures are tucked away somewhere else… On the other hand, maybe he took them all. Sure, we like to see photos of family, but aren’t we more prone to save those that include ourselves?”

“Silly me,” Hattie said. “That makes a lot of sense. I’ll keep looking,” She reached for another drawer.

Twenty minutes later, Cartney asked, “How about I run out for some McDonald’s?”

“Lunch?” Hattie asked. “What time is it?”

Cartney glanced at her phone. “Closing in on 1 PM.”

“Gosh darn it—I almost forgot. Howie stopped by the house and asked if he could check out this place.” Hattie called over to Muriel. “You don’t suppose Lewis would mind?”

“Howie? I’m sure it’s okay. Still, do you want me to call Lewis and ask?”

Hattie smiled inwardly; Muriel always jumped at any chance to contact Lewis. “Yes, that would be good. And if Lewis says it’s okay, I’m sure Howie would be happy to pick up some Chinese—there’s a place next door to his work.”

“Yumballs,” Muriel said with a light chuckle.

Cartney agreed. “I second that!”

Mike looked suspicious. “Who’s Howie?”

“He’s my son. Honestly, I’m not sure he wants to see the house as much as check that we’re not doing anything crazy.”

“Crazy? The three of you? How’s that possible?” Mike said, half-amused.

The three women exchanged smiles.

Hattie shook her head. “I know, right?”


Chapter 18: Newspapers

With Lewis’s approval, a call was made to Howie, and an order was placed for one large pork fried rice, some steamed dumplings, and a double order of General Tso chicken.

As they waited for Howie, Cartney wandered over to a pile of newspapers stacked haphazardly in the corner. “Jeez,” she muttered, nudging the leaning tower with her knee. “How far back do these go?”

Muriel picked up one and unraveled it. “Wow. This one’s from twenty years ago. What was up with that guy?”

Hattie frowned. “Packrat tendencies, maybe? People keep strange things for strange reasons.”

While pacing near the bookshelf, Mike Grady turned at the mention of hoarding. “Or maybe he kept them because they meant something. Some people hoard junk. Others hoard secrets.” His voice was tight, measured.

Cartney crouched down, flipping through a few of the papers. “I took a psych class once that covered hoarders. Some hoard because they fear losing important information, like needing an article from twenty years ago. Others do it because they tie memories to objects like each paper is a piece of their life. Then there are the ones who just can’t let go of things, even if they don’t have a good reason.”

Muriel tilted her head. “So it’s not just laziness?”

“Nope,” Cartney said. “It’s usually deeper than that. Trauma, anxiety, even loneliness—sometimes it’s about control. If they keep everything, they don’t risk losing anything.”

Mike crossed the room, his hands shoved deep into his pockets. “Or maybe,” he said, nudging a few papers with his boot, “he was hiding something in plain sight.”

Hattie glanced up at him. “Like what?”

Mike exhaled. “I don’t know. But Flynn was a private guy. Kept to himself, didn’t let people in.”

Cartney crouched and started rifling through the stack with renewed purpose. “If this guy kept decades of Sunday editions, we might be here all day.”

Hattie had a thought. “If they seem to be in order, maybe you should check what’s at the bottom. See how deep the hoarding goes.”

One by one, Cartney tossed each edition into a trash bag, a flurry of old headlines and yellowing pages filling the air. “Okay, twenty years back… twenty-five… Wow, this guy never threw anything away.”

Muriel peered over her shoulder. “What’s the oldest one?”

Mike dug down past Cartney’s arm, fingers moving quickly. He pulled out a brittle, crumbling newspaper. “Over forty years old.” He shook his head and set the paper aside. “Looks like a mix of hoarding and sentimentality to me. Unless you want to go through each paper to see if there’s something tucked inside, I’ll toss them.”

Cartney sighed. “Yeah, that’s probably a good idea. They look like they’ve just been stacked here and left to rot anyway.”

Mike grabbed and tossed the last handful of papers; his movements were brisk and purposeful. “I’ll bag these up and get rid of them now. It will clear more space for you.”

In no time, an entire corner of the library was emptied and uncluttered. Hattie took a deep breath. Progress felt good.


Chapter 19: Something New

Hattie opened the front door. Upon entry, Howie lifted a large brown bag. “Signed, sealed, and delivered. Who’s hungry?”

“Famished,” Cartney said.

“Great, and how about you, Muriel?”

“I’m so hungry I could eat a horse... but I’ll settle for dumplings.”

“Well then, we’re in business.” He stepped into the hallway. “Wow, this place is impressive—very period. Could be a movie set.”

Hattie agreed. “From what I can tell, the only changes have been in the kitchen. Otherwise, it’s quite a time capsule. Shall we eat first or give you a tour?”

“I have to be back in an hour.”

“Then let’s go upstairs,” Cartney said. “None of us have been up there yet.”

Hattie led the way. The stairs creaked under their steps as her hand glided along the polished wood railing.

Upstairs, the air carried the old scent of the pre-cleaned living room—not as strong as before but still reminiscent of dampness.

They gathered at the landing. The hallway stretched before them, lined with dark wainscoting and faded floral wallpaper. At the far end, sunlight filtered in through a tall window, its light softened by a long, gossamer lace curtain. Hattie took a deep breath; the scene, despite its decay, comforted her.

“Let’s take a look around together,” she suggested. “That way, if something jumps out at us, we’ll have each other for company.”

“Safety in numbers.” Muriel clapped her hands. “Into the breach!”

The first bedroom was spacious but dim, its heavy burgundy drapes blocked most of the light. A large four-poster bed with an ornate wooden frame dominated the space, with a pink chenille coverlet stretching across it. Hattie ran her fingers over the tufted puffs. “I remember having one of these.”

“So do I,” Muriel said. “In fact, I bought one from the shopping network.” She bit the inside of her cheek. “I wonder where it went.”

Hattie smiled. “It’s probably in the attic with all your other boxes.”

“Hmm… Yeah. I should go through that stuff. Hey, if I find it, I’ll give it to you for Christmas.” She turned to Howie. “Or maybe you’d like it… something to impress the ladies?”

He raised his hand. “That’s okay.”

Muriel smiled. “Now come on, Howie. These things are great—they wash easily and come out clean… well, except for the lint. I wouldn’t wash one with your darks.”

“Too bad. I mostly have darks.”

“Seriously? But—”

Cartney interrupted, “Muriel, guys, these days, have down comforters if they have anything at all.”

“Huh? You mean…” Muriel turned her attention to Howie. “Are you one of those real men?”

“Well, I do run a little hot… you know, when I sleep.”

Muriel winked. “How very neanderthal!”

He laughed. “Yeah, that’s me—a balding, middle-aged caveman who hasn’t had a date in months.”

Hattie stifled a laugh. “Maybe we should focus.” She pointed to a porcelain doll perched on a rocking chair, its glassy eyes staring blankly at the door. “What do you think?”

“If it moves,” Muriel said, “I’m cashing out.”

Cartney chuckled. “I suspect this was his mother’s bedroom.”

Hattie walked over to the vanity. Memories flooded in.

“Find something?” Muriel peered over her shoulder.

“Look here,” Hattie said. “I haven’t seen any of these in years.”

A flat mirror, reflecting an elegant brush and comb set, sat atop the vanity alongside a collection of delicate perfume bottles. Several bottles had a small bulb attached by a thin tube—the kind that, when squeezed, released a fine mist of fragrance. It was a forgotten touch of elegance from another era.

Cartney stooped down to examine the bottles. Some were smooth and simple, while others were adorned with intricate patterns and tiny gilded accents that caught the light. “They’re little works of art.”

“Yes,” Hattie agreed, “and very pretty.”

Muriel picked up one with a soft pink bulb and squeezed it. A faint floral scent drifted into the air. “I wonder what perfume this is. It smells like roses.”

“Or maybe violets,” Hattie suggested. “It reminds me of something my mother used to wear.”

Turning one of the bottles over to inspect the label, Cartney noted, “There’s no name, just a faint engraving on the bottom. Probably from when perfume was poured into bottles rather than mass-produced in spray cans.”

Hattie smiled. “Yes. Back when everything had a little more charm.” She felt a pang of nostalgia—and knew it was time to move on.

“Looky here. I found one,” Muriel called out.

Hattie joined her friend. “What is it?”

“A picture.” Muriel lifted a framed photo from the nightstand. The photo showed an older woman, a young man, and a teenage girl. The woman and girl sat together while the young man stood behind them.

“What year do you think this is?” Hattie asked, taking the frame to study it more closely. The colors had a slightly faded warmth, like the family photos she remembered from the mid-’70s—back when Orin had a full head of hair, and she often got a perm. The young woman’s sleek, center-parted hairstyle was typical of that era—soft and natural, with peasant blouses and stacked bracelets rather than heavy eyeliner or bold lipstick.

The man standing behind them looked older but not terribly, perhaps in his late twenties, with hair straggling over his ears. The older woman’s hair was neat and short, likely the result of regular salon visits.

“It’s got to be from the mid-’70s,” Hattie concluded. “That sleek, center-parted style was everywhere then.”

Howie, listening nearby, leaned in for a closer look. “She’s right,” he said. “That’s exactly how people dressed when I was in high school.”

Muriel squinted at the photo. “Are you sure about the timing?”

“Yeah,” Howie nodded. “By the time I got married, styles were already shifting. Suits got slimmer, and hair got bigger. If this were the ’80s, that guy would have had a mustache or more hairspray.”

Muriel chuckled. “Good to know. Hattie’s instincts are still sharp.”

Howie straightened up and turned to Hattie. “So, who are these people?”

Hattie ran her fingers along the edge of the frame. “That’s the question, isn’t it?”

Howie shrugged. “Shouldn’t be hard to find out.”

“Really? How?” she asked.

“For one thing, the picture is in a bedroom. I think it’s one of the women who lived in the house. Maybe she was the man’s mother and the teenager’s grandmother.”

“That makes sense,” Hattie said, though she noted, “I don’t have any pictures with names or dates to help identify them.”

“Ma, these people were heavy hitters in their time. I’m sure you’d find a ton of photographs in the society pages of the Express. They’re searchable.”

“Wow,” Cartney commented. “Great advice.”

“I got a million of them,” Howie added with a smile.

Hattie tucked the picture under her arm. “Let’s see what else we can find.”


Chapter 20: Something Blue

The bedroom next door felt thick with years of uncirculated dust. The furniture was heavy and dark—sturdy pieces built to last, yet lacking the warmth or personality one might expect in a private space. A wide bed with an ornate wooden headboard stood against the far wall, its faded quilt neatly pulled up as if waiting for someone who would never return.

Hattie stepped in first. “Not exactly inviting,” she murmured.

“It feels left behind,” Muriel added, running a finger across the dresser top and leaving a trail in the thick dust.

“Do you think this was Flynn’s room?” Howie asked, his tone tentative.

The idea didn’t sit right with Hattie. She surveyed the space: there was a stiffness here, a formality that didn’t match what little she knew of Flynn. Her gaze fell on a high-backed leather chair by the window, accompanied by a brass ashtray on a small table. The ashtray’s surface was cluttered with old cigarette butts—tips stained a sickly yellow. Nearby, a tarnished lighter and a wooden pipe stand held a single, well-used pipe added to the scene.

Hattie turned toward an armoire with its door slightly ajar. Pulling it open, she revealed a smoking jacket—a rich burgundy velvet piece with quilted black lapels. It was exactly the sort of garment an older man with a refined taste might wear.

“This wasn’t Flynn’s room,” Hattie declared as she opened a nearby door. “It’s connected to the room we just left. It must be his father’s.”

“How can you be so sure?” Howie asked.

“The connecting door gives it away. I once saw a similar setup in an old period drama—back then, it was common for spouses to have separate quarters.”

“Very astute, Ma,” Howie said with a soft smile.

Cartney spoke up. “Look, there are some books over there.”

They moved closer to a bookshelf lined with volumes in varying states—some in surprisingly good condition, others worn from years of handling. Military strategy, history, and law titles sat side by side with classic novels by Hemingway and Orwell, alongside a tattered copy of Moby Dick. On the second shelf, however, sat an untidy pile of magazines. The covers, slightly curled and yellowed at the edges, revealed titles like Hustler.

Muriel raised an eyebrow. “Well, that’s a bit more… uncouth.”

Cartney only smirked in response.

“What kind of magazines are these?” Hattie asked, leaning in for a closer look.

After a brief exchange of glances, Howie explained, “They’re what you might loosely call a gentleman’s magazine.”

“You mean like Playboy?” Hattie asked.

Howie nodded. “Yes.”

Before Hattie could reach for the magazine, Howie quickly interjected, “Ma, I don’t think you’d approve.”

“It’s not about my approval,” Hattie replied firmly. “I just want to see if there’s any hidden value. People sometimes slip things into magazines, and I’d like to check.”

Howie hesitated when Cartney added, “Hattie, you can just grab the magazine by the spine and shake it.”

“I appreciate the concern,” Hattie said, “but I’m capable of assessing this on my own.” With that, she picked up the magazine and noted the issue’s date. “This one’s from 1989... I wonder when Flynn’s father died.”

Howie nodded. “That’s a good question.”

“If he passed away before 1989, this must have belonged to Flynn. But if he died later, it could belong to either.” Hattie began flipping through the pages and soon realized that the photographs weren’t merely suggestive but explicit. Each image left nothing to the imagination. Her brows furrowed in disapproval as she noted that the models posed in a manner that felt less about allure and more about crude exhibitionism.

Then there were the cartoons. Lordy.

Hattie’s lips parted in silent horror as she took in a grotesque illustration paired with a punchline so vulgar she had to bite back a retort. “Good heavens,” she muttered under her breath. “Who would think like this?”

Muriel leaned over her shoulder and exhaled sharply. “I have no words.”

“Someone was proud to print this,” Hattie said, aghast. “They literally thought the world needed such filth.”

She closed the magazine. It wasn’t just a racy collection—it was something mean, the sort of thing a proper parent might confiscate out of sheer disgust rather than mere prudishness.

Hattie slipped the magazine under her arm. “I must know when the father died.”

She left the room determined to unsee what she had just seen.


Chapter 21: Something Ghoul

The upstairs was turning out to be more intriguing than the downstairs. Back in the hall, Hattie noticed that Howie had moved further ahead.

“There’s a full landing here,” he called out, vanishing around a corner. “Interesting… and a back staircase.”

Cartney joined him. “That’s odd… Wait a minute—maybe it goes down to the doctor’s office. We haven’t been in there yet.” She called over to her friends, “But something’s strange. Come see.”

Hattie and Muriel joined them and peered into the narrow stairwell.

“Do you notice anything?” Cartney asked.

Howie shrugged. “Looks like an old back stairway. What am I not seeing?”

“Hattie? Muriel?”

Muriel tilted her head, eyes narrowing. “I got it! Where’s all the crapola?”

“Yes,” Hattie said slowly, “that is strange. I guess they could’ve cleaned it when they did the other downstairs part. We may want to ask Lewis.”

Muriel nodded. “I’ll talk to him later.”

Howie moved a few steps to another door on the landing. “And what’s behind door number two?” He turned the knob and swept it open. “Of course—must be the maid’s quarters.”

A rush of cold air drifted down as Hattie looked up. The stairs were steep and narrow. Again, no clutter. But something caught her attention.

Her eyes swept the staircase, noting the absence of dust, the eerie neatness of it all. Then she saw it—something small, recent.

A curled leaf, damp and out of place, clung to the edge of a step.

She frowned. Earlier, she’d had to shake leaves off her boots at the threshold. The fall debris hadn’t been cleared before the snow, and now, with the melt, leaves were sticking to wet soles again.

But these leaves weren’t on the first floor. They were up here.

Her stomach tightened. Someone had been up there. And not long ago.

“Squirrels,” she muttered.

Howie turned. “What?”

“They might still be nesting up there,” she said, tilting her chin toward the dark stairwell.

That was all Howie needed. He stepped back. “We should skip it.”

Hattie exhaled, relieved by the excuse. While the others accepted her explanation, she knew the truth—squirrels didn’t track in leaves. People did.

She moved to the next door and tried the knob. It didn’t budge. She rattled it harder and turned to the others. “It’s locked.”

“Really?” Cartney came over to check. “Yes, you’re right.”

Muriel piped in. “That’s strange. Do you remember all those keys we found downstairs in the kitchen? Maybe one of them fits. Let’s talk to Lewis about this.”

Hattie nodded. “Good idea.”

“One more door before lunch,” Cartney said.

This one opened with a push, revealing a spacious bathroom with black and white tiled floors. The tiles still held a faint sheen in the hallway light. A large clawfoot tub sat beneath a foggy window; its enamel streaked with rust where the faucet had once dripped. An ornate sink with brass fixtures gleamed dully. The metal was tarnished green at the edges. The mirror above it, speckled with age, gave its reflections a fragmented, ghostly quality. Hattie studied her own face and frowned. The blurred silvering distorted her features. Unsettling.

Muriel peeked inside and wrinkled her nose. “Not much to see here.” She stepped back, unimpressed.

Hattie agreed. The towel racks were bare and the toilet bowl was bone dry. A brittle bar of soap sat cracked in the dish like sunbaked earth. The room felt untouched, forgotten.

Cartney opened the medicine cabinet. She paused. “Well, this is interesting.” She pulled out a small, dusty bottle.

Hattie stepped closer as Cartney rubbed at the glass, revealing faded lettering: Chloroform — For Anesthesia Use Only.

A prickling chill crept up Hattie’s spine.

“Who just keeps a bottle of chloroform lying around?” Muriel asked.

Howie exhaled. “That’s not something you’d expect to find in a normal household. Chloroform wasn’t like aspirin. It was used as an anesthetic.”

Cartney spoke up. “It must have come from the grandfather’s office.”

Yes, that was possible, thought Hattie, but doubt crept in. Wouldn’t something like this be in a locked cabinet? And why in the bathroom?

Cartney slipped the bottle back into place. “Well, I’m adding this to this house’s list of weird things.”

Hattie turned to the sink and reached for the faucet. The cold tap turned stiffly, but nothing came out. She tried the hot tap. There was a sputter and a gurgle when warm water burst out, not rusty but clear. Startled, she jerked her hand back.

“It works?” Cartney asked.

Hattie nodded but wondered. If the water ran clear and warm, who’s been around? She turned to the others. “Let’s eat,” she said, her voice distant.

* * *

“Well, ladies,” Howie said after swallowing a dumpling, “this is certainly an interesting job.” He looked at each of them in turn. “How long do you think it’ll take?”

Cartney shrugged. “A week or so, I expect. We can only find what we can find.”

“Then what? Any other jobs coming from him?”

Still testing the waters, Hattie thought. Clearly, her suspicious son hadn’t let up. “No one’s told me anything,” she said lightly. “Muriel, has he spoken with you?”

Muriel shook her head. “Nope. All I know is he wants this to wrap up.”

Hattie kept her mouth shut.

“Well, Ma,” Howie reached for another dumpling, “this is the kind of thing that shouldn’t get you in trouble. How do you feel about that?”

She smiled sweetly. How ironic. She had a gun, and she was fairly certain a man had been murdered.


Chapter 22: Research and Residue

Hattie settled at the dining room table with a cup of tea and a sense of vague dread. Beside her laptop sat the photo from Mrs. Elwood’s bedroom, a Hustler magazine from the husband’s room, and a handwritten note with one word: Chloroform.

As the steam curled up in front of her screen, she clicked into the Express archives and started scrolling through the society pages—a parade of grinning faces at fundraisers, ribbon cuttings, and charity balls. And wouldn’t you know it—the Elwoods were everywhere. Always smiling, always polished, always in the damn frame.

His tall, stone-faced father looked like he could’ve modeled for the Lincoln Memorial. His mother? All grace and high cheekbones, the kind of woman who probably never swore or got spinach in her teeth.

Flynn stood at a dance with an exuberant young woman in a pale blue gown. The caption read: Flynn Elwood and Betsy Boswell on the Dance Floor. Betsy leaned into him, her hand resting lightly on his shoulder. Flynn looked present but not engaged. The tux fit perfectly, the bow tie was crisp, but the smile? Pure obligation.

Hattie zoomed in on Betsy’s features, then looked over at the photograph from Mrs. Elwood’s bedroom—the one with Flynn standing to the side while his mother and a youngish woman sat on a sofa.

She studied both images carefully and shook her head. Of course, Flynn and the girl seemed older in the newspaper photo. Hattie held up the framed picture to the laptop screen. She shook her head. The girls were not the same. Betsy had different hair, a different build, and something else entirely in her expression. The young girl in the old photo had that shy look of someone trying to hide, not the bold confidence that Betsy clearly had.

Move along, Hattie thought. Nothing to see here. She widened the search when another curious photo popped up with the caption: The Elwoods at Home.

Hattie leaned toward the screen, and there the family sat—Mr. and Mrs. Elwood with their son, Flynn, around ten or eleven, wedged between them. The boy had that forced, uncomfortable look kids get when made to dress up and smile for strangers. His posture was stiff, his shoulders drawn in, and though his hair was neatly combed, one defiant wave refused to lay flat.

Hattie sighed. Flynn had all the signs of a poor little rich boy. And the beat went on.

She moved on to the Hustler magazine. So, who did that belong to—father or son? She clicked into the obituaries and found it easily. Farlan Elwood, beloved husband, father, and dedicated philanthropist, joined the Lord after a short illness... She browsed for a date. Farlan had passed away five years before the edition of Hustler they found. Unless Justine had unusual tastes, it likely belonged to Flynn.

Hattie looked out the window. What this ultimately meant, she had no idea. Only one thing about Flynn seemed evident—he was an odd duck.

She adjusted her glasses and leaned toward the screen again—only one more rabbit hole to go.

She typed: chloroform use history

Dozens of results. She clicked the first.

Chloroform was widely used as an anesthetic in the 1800s and early 1900s, especially during surgeries and childbirth. Eventually phased out due to safety concerns—including respiratory failure—it was replaced by safer alternatives.

Okay, Hattie thought. So Flynn’s grandfather, a doctor then, could’ve had it. But how would a bottle of the stuff still be in the house?

She opened a new tab.

Why would someone have chloroform at home?

Chloroform was once available over the counter and used as a household solvent, stain remover, and even as an ingredient in cough syrups…

“Lovely,” she muttered. “Little dab’ll do ya.”

So, it wasn’t just for doctors. Any household could’ve had it, especially decades ago.

Then a new thought struck her.

Does chloroform expire?

She hit enter.

Over time, chloroform breaks down—especially if exposed to air or light—and can produce phosgene gas, a highly toxic substance once used in chemical warfare…

Hattie sat up straight.

Phosgene?

So, an old bottle, forgotten in a dusty cabinet, could actually turn into something deadly?

She didn’t like that at all.

She was about to shut the laptop when one last search caption caught her eye:

Chloroform sniffing in the 1970s

Ugh. She clicked.

Reports from the late 1970s show teenagers experimenting with inhalants like chloroform to get high. Sometimes paired with adult magazines, this practice led to unconsciousness, respiratory complications, and in several tragic cases, death.

Her mouth went dry.

Teenagers. Hustler. Chloroform.

She stared at the screen.

Could Flynn have been doing this?

She pushed the laptop away and stared out the window. The air suddenly felt heavy.

She didn’t like where this was going. Not one bit.


Chapter 23: Horace Elton Ogg

The following day, Hattie busied herself with the household chores she had ignored. As she worked around the house, Lucy followed, ever watchful.

“Well, little Missy, I see you’ve been batting around the hard candies again.”

“Meow.”

Hattie stooped between the couch and the end table and picked up some curled cellophane wrappers.

“Now, where exactly are the candies? I know you don’t eat them—you just like the noise.”

“Meow.”

Hattie considered pushing the couch away from the wall. That’s where the candies usually ended up—stuck with dust and cat hair. She decided against it. No one looked under the couch. Well, no one except for the ants. But it wasn’t ant season yet.

Ten minutes later, she was sweeping kitty litter from the bathroom floor as Lucy stood in the doorway, tail flicking.

“Now, listen. I thought we had a deal—you’d wipe your feet on this brand-new mat I bought you.”

Lucy said nothing this time; she just swiped her tail like a bored aristocrat.

After a few more touch-ups, Hattie’s thoughts drifted to Orin, then to someone else entirely. She glanced at Lucy.

“Should I call him? To see how he’s coming along?”

“Meow.”

Hattie smiled. “I take that as a yes. But I don’t want to be too forward.”

Except it wasn’t about being forward. She had never called a man in her life. That just wasn’t done. Then again, she wouldn’t be calling him. She’d just be… checking in. Out of concern. Purely polite.

Until another idea struck.

Later, with chores done, she returned to the dining room, logged into Facebook, and typed “Horatio” into the search bar.

She looked at Lucy. “I’m not spying. I’m just being curious. Besides, he spied on me. How else did he know my address?”

Lucy was now sitting on the dining room table.

“There aren’t any Horatios,” Hattie said.

“Meow.”

“You’re being redundant. Give me something useful. What other names can I try?”

“Meow.”

“Is that your final answer?”

“Meow.”

“Wait… I’ve got an idea.”

“Meow. Meow.”

And with that, Hattie typed in Specks.

One result popped up.

Horace Elton Ogg, aka Horace E. O. His profile pic had him sitting in a recliner with Specks on his lap.

Hattie squinted at the screen. Horace Elton Ogg—Horace E. O. No wonder she hadn’t found him under Horatio.

She clicked the photo. The caption read: An old recliner, a well-worn man, and one loyal dog—estate sales don’t get better than this.

That confirmed it.

Another photo was even more telling—an antique roll-top desk covered in old maps, a magnifying glass, and a pocket watch resting beside a neatly stacked pile of books. The caption?

“They don’t make ’em like they used to.”

Hattie smirked. That sounded about right.

She scrolled through a few posts. One featured a vintage rifle:

“They let me buy this, but I can’t buy a six-pack without showing ID. Go figure.”

That sounded exactly like the man who had slipped her a derringer and a single bullet like it was a party favor.

Another post showed a recent estate sale find:

“Scored an old Victrola today. Works like a dream. Don’t come looking for me if I disappear into the past.”

Hattie chuckled—then paused at a cryptic update from a few days ago:

“Some people talk to the dead. Some people listen.”

Her fingers hovered over the mouse.

That was around the time he’d asked her about speaking to his late wife.

Was he actually trying?

A few more clicks and an old photo surfaced—buried in his uploads. A young man in uniform stood next to a woman with an enormous beehive hairdo.

The caption: Back when we thought we had all the time in the world.

His wife.

Hattie studied the image. She was smiling at him, caught mid-laugh. The kind of woman who looked like she could win an argument—and make you like it.

Hattie tapped her fingers against the table.

Horace E. O. wasn’t just a widower with a dog and a thing for old maps. There was history there. Layers.

She looked over at Lucy. “Well, I’ll be.”

In just ten minutes, she had learned more about Horatio than she had in their conversations.

And strangely… she had more questions now than ever.

More oddly still, silent, Lucy climbed onto her lap and purred.


Chapter 24: MIA Again

“He’s at it again,” Muriel said as soon as Hattie opened the door.

Confused, Hattie asked, “Who’s at what?”

“My boyfriend… Moon pie, my foot.” She stomped into the kitchen, breathing heavily.

“Muriel, please calm down. You’re scaring me.”

Muriel waved Hattie off. “I’m fine. Don’t worry.”

“Okay. Good. Now let’s…” Hattie looked at the clock. It was three in the afternoon. “Would you like something to drink?”

No response.

“So you didn’t have your regular date last night?”

“Oh yeah. We went out for a fish fry.” She got a faraway look. “It was delicious. And then we went to his place and watched a movie about Mae West. She was a remarkable woman. And guess what!?? He told me I reminded him of her.”

For a moment, Hattie wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing. As if reading her mind, Muriel said, “And to think I took it as a compliment. I’m an idiot.”

“Now stop that, Muriel. He’s crazy about you. Besides, I’m sure he was referring to your wit and charm.”

Muriel bit the inside of her cheek. “You think so?… Hmm… So how does that explain that he’s at the Mercury Club?”

Hattie felt her brow furrow. “You mean now? This minute?”

Muriel glanced at the kitchen clock. “Well, about five minutes ago. That’s probably how long I got ready and walked over here. I should go and ask Ralph if he’d take me there.”

“Really? You would do that?”

“Sure, why not… Well, okay, probably not… Hattie, what are my options?”

Recalling what Cartney had said, Hattie took a deep breath. “Well, um… Cartney did mention to me that she knows someone who works there, and if we were ever concerned, to let her know, and she’d have someone check, you know, on the situation.”

“What does that mean?”

“I don’t know. Should I call her?”

“Well, hell yes. But whoever’s going to check must be discreet. Would that be possible?”

Hattie reached for her phone. “I’ll put her on speaker, and we can ask.”

Muriel leaned over the table and rubbed her forehead. “Lordy. What have I done wrong? Maybe I talk too much. Hattie, do I talk too much?”

“Of course, you talk too much. That’s why we all love you.”

“Seriously? All of you?”

“Yes, and yes. Now, let’s call Cartney.”

Moments later, Cartney was on speakerphone.

“Cartney, Muriel’s over at my house.”

“Partying without me?”

“No, something’s come up, and we were wondering if you could help us.”

“Sure. What’s up?”

“Well, um…” Hattie began, but Muriel interrupted. “He’s at the Mercury Club. He didn’t tell me he was going there. In fact, he said he had work today.” Her voice trembled. “Can you help me figure this out?”

“Sure thing. He’s there now?”

“Yes.”

“Okay, I’m going to contact someone. If he’s in the dining room, we can take a picture. What do you think of that idea?”

Muriel took a shaky breath. “Sure.”

For some moments, Cartney didn’t speak. “Muriel, you sure you want to know?”

“Yes. Not knowing is killing me.”

“I get that,” Cartney said. “But let me tell you, Muriel, I’ve known a lot of boys and men, and Lewis is one of the best. Hands down.”

Muriel nodded and wiped a tear off her cheek.

“I’ll try to have someone take some pictures of Lewis and who he’s with. I can probably get it within the hour if he’s still there. Are you sure you’re ready?”

Muriel nodded.

Hattie spoke up. “Yes, she’s ready.”

After hanging up, Hattie got two glasses and some whiskey.

Twenty minutes later, Hattie’s phone dinged. It was Cartney. “Hello?”

“Okay, they’re attached in a text. Now, I don’t want anyone freaking out. I’m coming over.”

* * *

Before opening the attachments, Muriel took a long swig. Hattie followed. After a click, one attachment filled the screen.

It wasn’t good.

A woman, not young or old, probably in her fifties, sat backlit by a bay window, outlining her perfectly coiffed hair and makeup. The lighting gave her a soft glow, almost too perfect like she was staged for a magazine shoot rather than captured in a casual moment. Her expression was unreadable—not quite a smile or smirk, but something in between, like she had just swallowed a big fat canary.

Muriel let out a slow breath and sat back. “Well. That settles it.”

Hattie frowned. “Settles what?”

Muriel waved at the screen. “I can’t compete with that.”

“Oh, for heaven’s sake—” Hattie started, but Muriel shook her head.

“She’s polished, she’s poised, and look at her. She knows how to sit straight.”

Hattie blinked. “What does that even mean?”

Muriel sighed. “It means I hunch, and I’m out of my league. I’m always moving, fidgeting, and talking too much. My hair has a mind of its own. I spill things. Meanwhile, this one”—she gestured to the screen—"she’s the kind of woman who makes a man slow down just by existing.”

Hattie rolled her eyes. “You sound ridiculous.”

Muriel ignored her, taking another sip. “I should just throw in the towel.”

“Throw in the towel? You’re not in a boxing match.”

Muriel scoffed. “No, but I might as well be. And I’m losing.”

Hattie huffed. “Lewis isn’t a prize you win, Muriel. And besides, what exactly are you basing this on? A single picture? For all we know, this woman has the personality of a wet dishrag.”

Muriel didn’t respond. She just stared at the screen, something unreadable flickering behind her eyes.

Hattie wasn’t having it. She reached for the next attachment and clicked it open.

This one was worse.

The woman was still there, but she wasn’t alone this time. Lewis was sitting opposite her, sipping a drink and wearing a suit.

Muriel inhaled sharply.

Hattie’s stomach tightened. She hadn’t expected that.

For a moment, neither of them spoke. The air between them thickened, heavy with unspoken thoughts.

Then Muriel said quietly, “Does he look like he’s in love with her?”

Hattie studied the image, searching Lewis’s face. He wasn’t laughing, but he wasn’t scowling either. His expression was… neutral. Maybe even a little tired. His posture was relaxed but not overly so. His gaze wasn’t locked on the woman—he seemed to be looking past or through her.

Hattie exhaled. “No,” she said firmly. “He doesn’t.”

“You sure?”

Hattie nodded. “I know what Lewis looks like when he’s in love. There’s a glimmer in his eyes and a smile that lights up the room. This is not it.”

Muriel swallowed hard. “Then what is it?”

Hattie wasn’t sure.


Chapter 25: Cartney’s Two Cents

“Okay, now listen,” Cartney said. “We got this. As I see it, we should deal with this head-on. It’s the quickest and least painful.” She looked at Muriel. “You have to talk to Lewis and get it out in the open.”

Muriel swallowed hard. “I can’t do that.”

“Why the hell not?”

Muriel bit her lip. “There are so many reasons. If I say anything, he’ll know I’m spying on him. I don’t think he’d like that.”

Cartney shrugged. “Well, he’s the guy doing stuff behind your back. What are you supposed to do? Be a mealy-mouthed mouse and shut your trap?”

Muriel took a sip of her drink. Hattie couldn’t be sure, but her friend’s eyes seemed brimming with tears.

“There has to be another way to get a handle on this,” Hattie said gently. “After all, I can’t see Lewis being so… duplicitous.”

“Good point. Okay,” Cartney said, “onto plan number two.”

Muriel jumped in. “You have more than one plan?”

“Muriel, when it comes to men, I got them coming out of my—” She waved a hand. “Okay, plan number two. Hattie talks to Lewis.”

Hattie was suddenly in the crosshairs. “Talk to Lewis about what?”

“You tell him how Muriel feels kinda sad because he’s broken a few dates. Then, see what he says. Easy peasy.”

Muriel hesitated, then nodded. “That’s… doable. He likes you, Hattie.”

Hattie shifted in her seat. “I don’t know. It feels kinda gossipy or something.” She glanced at Muriel. “And it just prolongs everything. This is about you and Lewis.”

Cartney drummed her fingers on the table. “Yeah, you’re right. The whole thing is too high school. We’re better than that. Right?”

Muriel sighed deeply. “I’m okay. Let’s drop it. Whatever happens, happens.”

Hattie turned to Cartney. “Any other plans?”

“Of course. There’s plan number three.” Cartney leaned in. “This one is diabolical.”

Hattie didn’t like the sound of that.

“How diabolical?” Muriel asked.

“Well,” Cartney said, “it probably will get us fired.”

Muriel shook her head. “Lewis would never fire us.”

“Don’t think so? How about we track the little tart and expose her for what she is.”

“To be honest, this may not even be about her,” Muriel said, voice quieter now. “I think this is all about me not having confidence… or experience… with men.”

Cartney shook her head. “Before we keep getting nowhere, why not text him right now? See how he responds.”

Muriel hesitated. “What would I even say?”

“How about, ‘Hey, just checking in. Hope all is well.’ Harmless, but direct.”

Hattie nodded. “Good idea. If he’s got nothing to hide, he’ll respond.”

Muriel exhaled. Nodded. Picked up her phone.

She typed, hit send, and let out a breath.

Hattie kept the conversation going as Muriel’s eyes flicked to her phone every few seconds.

Cartney tapped the table. “Nothing yet? Maybe he’s composing a heartfelt apology. Or Googling ‘how to break up with someone without seeming like a jerk.’”

Muriel shot her a look but said nothing. She rechecked her phone.

Minutes passed.

Then—bleep.

Her breath hitched as she read it out loud. “Hey, sorry, busy day. Talk later?”

Muriel crossed her arms. “Kinda vague and dismissive, don’t you think?”

No one argued with her.

“Let me make a call,” Cartney said. Moments later, she was on the phone. “Hey, Lesh, are they still there?... Any idea how much longer?... Can you give them a free dessert and coffee on the house?... Great. Text me when the woman leaves.”

Hattie glanced at Muriel, whose face had lost all color.

After hanging up, Cartney stood. “Let’s get a move on.”

“Where are we going?”

“To the Mercury Club. Let’s hope she’s driving her own car so we can get a plate number.”

Muriel hesitated. “But what if she stays with Lewis?”

“I haven’t figured that out yet.” Cartney turned to Hattie. “Are you in?”

Hattie hesitated. The sane answer was no. Instead, she heard herself say, “Yes. Of course.”

Had she agreed, or had the whiskey worked its magic?

“Great. Listen, we are pros at this surveillance shit. Let’s go. We have ten minutes.”

* * *

Muriel, Cartney, and Hattie sat in the car, watching the Mercury Club entrance like seasoned detectives—albeit slightly tipsy gumshoes.

Then—movement.

Lewis opened the door and waited for the woman to pass onto the sidewalk.

Hattie leaned forward.

Once outside, the two exchanged a couple of words, then Lewis nodded and walked away in a different direction.

Hattie reached for Muriel’s shoulder. “Good sign. Looks like they didn’t come together.”

Muriel stayed quiet.

“Okay.” Cartney grabbed her sunglasses. “You ladies need to scoot down as much as possible until the coast is clear. Let’s follow her.”

Tucked along the backseat, Hattie felt the car swerve, then bump as they got out of the parking lot.

“Okay, I’m on her. The woman is a slow driver. This will be cake.” Cartney grabbed her phone and turned to them. “You guys can sit up now.” Then, she relayed the plate number to her cell.

The late-model sedan moved smoothly through traffic, taking a few turns before pulling into a parking lot outside a sleek, modern office building. The sign read: Ravenwood Development Group.

“Uh-oh,” Cartney said. “I know that name.”

Hattie frowned. “You do?”

“Yeah. They’re in bed with half the city’s real estate deals—commercial, residential, you name it.” Cartney paused. “Not exactly the nicest people.”

Hattie watched as the woman greeted someone leaving the building. Hmm… The woman was not just stopping by—she belonged here.

“So now what?” Muriel said.

Cartney faced her. “I got her plate. I’ll get some answers.”


Chapter 26: Catcher in the Rye

Back at the mansion, Hattie, Muriel, and Cartney had returned to the library. Hattie settled onto a settee with two boxes of photographs, trying to find the young woman pictured in the photograph found upstairs. So far, no luck.

Cartney broke the silence. “Has anyone seen that atlas Father John was talking about?”

Muriel had taken on the task of opening and fanning each book to make sure nothing important was stuck inside. “I haven’t found any maps... But I did put something aside.” She looked over her pile. “Yes. Here it is… It’s a paperback copy of The Catcher in the Rye. It looks like it came from the library of the Franklin Academy. The student’s name was Rachel Carver.”

“Hmm,” Cartney said. “The school sounds familiar. And so does that name. Wasn’t she an environmentalist?”

Hattie piped in. “That school was a prestigious high school that closed years ago, over on Washington.”

Surprised, Cartney said, “Really? I wouldn’t think they’d have a copy of that book. Even when I was in high school, the school board had a fit about it.”

Muriel flipped the book over in her hands. “I saw on that antiques show that first editions of this book can be valuable,” she mused. “What do you think—trash or Goodwill?”

Cartney shrugged. “Figuring out the worth of these books would slow us down. I say we put it in the Goodwill pile, then let fate decide. For better or worse, whoever finds it might get lucky.”

Muriel agreed and placed it on top of one pile. “So, Cartney, did you find out that woman’s real name?”

“Not yet... And have you spoken with Lewis?”

“Yes. We went out yesterday to this bistro downtown for brunch.”

Cartney tapped her fingers on the table. “Sounds upper crust. What did you order?”

“Eggs Benedict and Bloody Marys.”

“So, everything went well?”

Muriel beamed. “Very well. Thank you.”

“Good to hear. Should I still try to find out her name?”

“Well, it can’t hurt. You know, just in case.”

Hattie wasn’t sure what “just in case” meant. Still, she was glad that Muriel seemed happy, at least for now.

The door creaked open, and Mike Grady stepped inside, brushing dust off his hands. “How’s it going in here? Looks like you’ve got quite the collection to sort through.”

“Making progress,” Muriel said. “We’ve got piles for donation, trash, and a few things to keep.”

Mike nodded, stepping closer. “Let me know what you want hauled out. I’ll take care of it.”

His gaze landed on the book Muriel had set aside. He picked up The Catcher in the Rye, turning it over in his hands. Watching from her seat, Hattie noticed the shift in his expression… a flicker of curiosity. He opened the book, and his jaw tightened ever so slightly.

“We think it might be worth something,” Muriel said.

“Yes,” he said with some distraction, fanning a few pages.

“Have you read it?”

He nodded and cleared his throat. “Eons ago. I’m surprised a school like Franklin Academy had a copy of this.”

Muriel chuckled. “That’s what Cartney said.”

Cartney pulled out her phone. “I should check something.” She punched her phone keyboard, then sat straighter. “If The Catcher in the Rye is a first-edition Signet from 1953, and it’s in pristine condition—no markings, no creases, nothing—it could be worth between $200 and $500.” She looked over to Mike. “Who’s the publisher?”

Mike checked. “Says Bantam.”

Cartney smirked. “Yeah, I figured. Bantam didn’t print the earliest paperbacks, so if it’s one of those, it’s a later reprint. It’s probably not worth much. Maybe around ten bucks.”

Muriel gave him a pointed look. “So, you’re not retiring on this one.”

Mike shrugged. “Nope. But hey, it’s still a cool find. And at least I can say I held a piece of history.”

Muriel smirked. “A ten-dollar piece of history.”

Hattie spoke up. “Well, maybe whoever finds it at the second-hand store will get more than they bargained for.”

Mike gave a short nod. “Yeah. Maybe.”

A few minutes later, he excused himself, promising to come back for the boxes in the afternoon.

As soon as the door shut behind him, Cartney said, “Did anyone else see that?”

Muriel glanced up. “See what?”

“Mike took that book. He didn’t put it in the donation pile—he put it in his pocket.”

Then, out of the blue, Hattie remembered the environmentalist’s name. Rachel Carson! Funny how her mind worked. She grabbed an odd piece of paper, wrote it down, and put it in her purse.


Chapter 27: Hattie’s Suspicion

As the three sat with delivered pizza, Cartney asked Hattie, “Any luck with the photos?”

Hattie shrugged. “I made some headway with finding pictures from the society pages—you know, what Howie suggested. As we suspected, it was Flynn’s mother, Justine, with Flynn in that picture on the bedstand. But I couldn’t find that young woman on any society pages. Oddly, though, I did find something this morning that seemed promising or maybe nothing at all.”

Cartney stopped chewing. “Like what?”

“I’ll show you.” Hattie retrieved some loose photos and set them next to the framed picture. “The setting is almost the same, except in place of the young woman, there is this huge fern right next to the couch. I’m thinking they moved the fern to make room for the woman to sit. Or maybe it was taken at a different time, and the young woman was swapped out for the fern.”

Cartney leaned forward and pointed. “So that’s Flynn? Not a particularly happy guy.”

Muriel reached out. “Let me see... He does look kinda haughty. Bah, typical rich kid. Probably spoiled rotten being the only namesake.”

“Kinda harsh?” Cartney said.

Muriel shrugged. “I have to say. I’m not sure I care for this guy. Sure, I’m sorry he was a hoarder and died in an awful way, but… I mean, did he ever work a day in his life? And what was up with that magazine? Who looks at stuff like that? It’s creep-o-zoid.”

“Some men resent women,” Cartney said. “Nothing new… Now, I’m not saying it’s right.”

“Hattie,” Muriel said. “What do you think?”

Hattie shook her head. “What’s that you always say? Oh, yes… it’s above my pay grade. Returning to the picture, I thought maybe the young woman was removed from the shot. I can’t imagine why. But I know professional photographers often manipulated pictures back then.”

Cartney agreed. “Even more so nowadays.”

“Anyway, I’m still on the hunt. But if I can’t figure it out, I’ll have to let it go. Besides, I’ve been thinking about other things. I didn’t want to mention anything because Howie was around, but I can’t stop thinking about it.”

“Like what?” Cartney asked.

“That upstairs. I think someone’s been coming into the house.”

Muriel’s brow furrowed. “Huh? You mean recently?”

Hattie nodded. “Remember when I turned on the faucet? The water was warm and clear. My water stays cold for at least a minute in this weather, and when water sits in the pipes, it’s usually rusty.”

“Creep-o-zoid, for sure. Cartney, what do you think?”

“I guess they could have one of those on-demand water tanks.”

“And there was something else. When I looked up the stairs to the third floor, there was a wet leaf, just like when I came into the house from the outside. I had to pull it off my shoe.”

“Maybe a squirrel brought it in,” Muriel suggested.

“Yeah, for sure. Anyway, I’m wondering if putting some cameras in the hallways would be a good idea. You know, to make sure no one’s sneaking around.”

Cartney’s face lit up, the mystery momentarily forgotten. “Great idea! Should we tell Lewis?”

“Yes. He needs to know.”

“Would you like me to speak with him?” Muriel offered.

Hattie and Cartney shared a glance.

“That would be great,” Hattie said. “I can sometimes get a little carried away, but it can’t do any harm, right?”

Cartney smiled. “Hattie, I’m glad you’re not in my classes. You’d be blowing the curve.”


Chapter 28: Father John Returns

The knock at the window was soft but distinct.

“Did you hear something?” Hattie asked.

Muriel and Cartney paused and listened. Then it came again—a tap, followed by a voice.

“Sorry. Is anyone around? This is Father John. I want to return some books I borrowed.”

Hattie opened the shutters. Father John stood outside with a stack of books and a polished smile.

She motioned toward the side of the house. “Come around to the kitchen door.” Before she left, she turned to her friends. “I’ve got to find out how much he knows about Flynn.”

Moments later, Hattie and Father John returned to the library.

“There,” he said, “back where they belong.” When he heaved the books onto the table, one fell to the floor. He bent down, retrieved it, and placed it with the others.

The book caught Muriel’s eye. She read the title aloud. “True Crime: Unsolved Mysteries of the 20th Century. So, Flynn read this kind of thing?” she asked.

Father John chuckled. “Oh, Flynn had a wide range of interests. He was an unusual man.”

“None of us knew Flynn,” Hattie said. “What was he like?”

Father John hesitated before answering. “Flynn was a private man. He didn’t trust easily. But if he let you in, you’d see there was more to him than most people assumed.”

“I suppose that’s like most of us. Anyway, I got the impression,” Cartney said, “that he was forgetful and confused. Did you find this to be true?”

He nodded. “I’m afraid so. It happened slowly, but then the last few years were rough. I visited him once a month. He had good days and bad days.”

“Did he ever talk about his family?” Hattie asked.

Father John tilted his head. “A little. His father was a strict man—business-minded. His mother was particular. Kept lists for everything. His grandparents, now they were the real influence in his life.”

Hattie nodded, encouraging him to talk more. “How so?”

“They lived big—money, success, influence. But there was a downside. I got the impression they were intolerant, self-absorbed, and opinionated. There was a way, and there was their way. Flynn talked about them a lot. As he got older, less so.”

“Did you ever meet them?”

He shook his head. “By the time I came here, most of them were long gone. I only met his mother. In fact, I met her first. She liked attending mass.”

Hattie smiled. “Sounds like an interesting family. So Flynn was an only child?”

“As far as I knew. Flynn never directly said he had siblings, but sometimes he talked like he wasn’t alone growing up. He mentioned ‘we’ instead of ‘I’ now and then. But then I thought he was talking about himself and his mother. As I said, Flynn didn’t share much. He kept to himself.”

A silence stretched between them before Hattie shifted tactics. “Do you pass by this house often?”

Father John glanced at her. “Probably every day. Why?”

“Ever notice anything unusual? A light on at night? Anything like that?”

There was a slight delay before he answered. “A light?… Not that I recall. Do you think someone’s been inside?”

Hattie shrugged. “I don’t know. I’m just wondering.”

“Well,” Father John said, with an air of concern, “I’ll certainly keep an eye out. Give me your number, and if I see anything, I’ll call you.” He pulled out a small notebook, flipped to an empty page, and took down Hattie’s number.

“There,” he said, slipping the notebook back into his coat. “Always good to be cautious.” He looked around the room. “Should I put these books back on the shelf?”

“No, don’t bother. We’ll go through them and decide whether it goes into a bag or a box.”

“Gotcha,” he said.

He started to head out but stopped. “Please call me if I can help in any way or if you have any questions.”

“We certainly will,” Hattie said.

As he left the library, Hattie remembered how surprised she’d been by that open drawer in the kitchen the other day. She said, “Let me see you out so I can lock the door.”


Chapter 29: Lainey Postman

While driving to the mansion for another day's work, Cartney announced, “The woman’s name is Lainey Postman. From what I can tell, she’s currently an out-of-work actress in regional theater.”

“How’d you find that out?” Muriel asked.

“Which part? Her name or occupation?”

“Either or both.” Muriel turned and winked at Hattie. “Curious minds need to know.”

“Facebook.”

Hattie had a question. “But how did you find her name if you didn’t have it?”

“Oh, that’s a secret.”

“What?!” Muriel said. “You’re gonna leave your tribe in the dark? C’mon, little missie, spill the beans.”

Cartney turned serious. “Listen, I can’t be specific, but I know someone who knows someone.”

“This knowing someone-who-knows-someone is getting old,” Muriel huffed. “How the frig do you know all these people?”

“I’m adorable.”

Muriel smirked. “You mean evil.”

“Anyway, the point is Facebook is wide open. Crazy what people put on that site.”

Hattie piped in. “What else did you learn?”

“Let’s see. She’s a Libra. Likes chicken wings and Mojitos.”

Muriel smirked. “Well, at least she has taste. Is she married? In a relationship?”

Cartney shrugged. “Not that I could tell.”

Muriel suddenly disengaged and looked out the window.

“Muriel, all that means is that she didn’t say anything, and there were no pictures of kids or men hanging on her.”

“I wonder if she has a lover.”

Hattie frowned. Muriel wasn’t going to drop it. Hattie took the lead. “What else did you find?”

“Her last acting gig was six months ago in Steel Magnolias at some community theater. She’s posted about needing a new opportunity but hasn’t said much else. No recent travel pictures, no mention of a job. Just the usual inspirational quotes and a lot of selfies.”

Muriel spoke up. “So, she doesn’t work for that development company?”

“Not that I can tell,” Cartney said. “I’ll keep digging. Anyway, she had some funny inspirational quotes like The best roles aren’t given; they’re taken.”

“Humph,” Muriel said.

Hattie leaned back, thinking that her friend’s lack of humor was a bad sign.

Cartney continued, “And there was another one: Opportunity knocks… but breaking in works too.”

Muriel snorted. “That’s not inspiration—that’s a felony.”

Hattie didn’t want to feed Muriel’s insecurity. She shook her head. “What else?”

“A little misdirection never hurt anyone.”

Muriel huffed. “Sounds like a motivational speech for a con artist.”

Hattie sighed. “And there wasn’t a connection with Lewis,  you know, as if she needed a lawyer?”

Cartney shook her head. “None that I could find.”

Hattie exhaled, stumped.

Muriel, however, was still caught on something. “So what the heck is she doing with Lewis?”

Her friend’s tone had shifted. Hattie recognized it immediately—Muriel was backtracking, slipping into that space where doubt and hurt crept in.

Hattie softened her voice. “Listen, Muriel, are you still not going to talk to Lewis? Just ask him. What harm could it do?”

Muriel fixed her gaze on the road ahead. She was quiet before she finally shook her head. “I’ll do it when I’m ready.”

Hattie exchanged a look with Cartney, but neither of them pushed further. They’d let Muriel sit with it—for now.

The car bumped along the gravel drive, the mansion looming ahead, a stark contrast to the quiet storm brewing in the front seat. Muriel hadn’t said another word. She was deep in thought, her fingers drumming lightly against the armrest, her gaze distant. Hattie had seen this before—how Muriel withdrew when something hit too close to home.

Cartney, ever the observer, leaned back in her seat. “Muriel, if this is about—”

Muriel cut her off with a wave of her hand. “It’s about nothing. Just… thinking.”

Hattie wasn’t convinced. She and Muriel had known each other too long for this kind of dodge to work. “Thinking about what?”

“Hypotheticals,” Muriel said, her voice tight. “Like, say this Lainey character is just some washed-up actress looking for a break. What if she sees Lewis as her golden ticket?”

Hattie frowned. “Lewis isn’t exactly rolling in money.”

Muriel sighed. “No, but he’s solid. Reliable. A man with a home, a routine, a good reputation. That’s appealing to a certain kind of person. And if she’s desperate—”

Cartney interrupted. “That’s a lot of assumption for someone we barely know.”

Muriel didn’t respond.

Hattie leaned toward her friend. “Muriel, what’s going on here?”

Muriel hesitated. “I don’t know. Maybe I don’t like surprises.”

Cartney raised an eyebrow. “Or maybe you’re afraid.”

Muriel’s jaw tightened. She said nothing.

Hattie decided to ease the tension. “Listen, maybe we’re overcomplicating this. Maybe Lainey Postman is just some woman Lewis met, and it doesn’t mean anything.”

“I suppose,” Muriel murmured, but her tone said otherwise. Then, almost absently, she added, “I don’t understand why he keeps seeing her at the Mercury Club.”

That silenced both Hattie and Cartney.

Cartney sat up straighter. “You know, that’s an interesting observation.”

Hattie’s stomach tightened. She’d been so caught up in the who of it all that she hadn’t thought about the where. The Mercury Club wasn’t just some casual bar. It was quiet and private, the kind of place where people met when they didn’t want to be seen.

“I know,” Muriel continued, “it sounds so darn secretive. I mean, why not a coffee shop? A restaurant? Why go to a place practically a whisper away from a speakeasy?”

Cartney exhaled. “Yeah, that is weird. If they were just friends or coworkers or whatever, why meet there?”

Hattie didn’t like the direction this was going. She wasn’t one for jumping to conclusions, but the question gnawed at her, too. Lewis wasn’t a secretive man—at least, he never had been. And yet, here he was, meeting some woman no one knew much about in a place that specialized in discretion. “Maybe he has a reason,” she offered, though even to her ears, it sounded thin.

Muriel scoffed. “Of course, he has a reason. The question is: what the hell is it?”

The mansion was just ahead now, its grand facade looking even more imposing in the late morning light.

With a decision made, Hattie buttoned her coat and unlocked her seatbelt. When she returned home, she would look up Lainey Postman herself. Go straight to Facebook, scroll through her pictures, read between the lines, and get a better sense of what—or who—they were dealing with. Something about this woman wasn’t sitting right.


Chapter 30: Ledger

They were finally making headway in the library. Only one wall of books and the cubbies in the old Victorian rolltop desk remained.

As Muriel and Cartney sorted through stacks of dusty volumes, Hattie sat at the massive desk, pulling out drawers, one after another. Some were tiny, filled with old paper clips, brittle rubber bands, and yellowed business cards. Others were deeper, revealing dried-up inkwells, fountain pens with corroded nibs, and a dusty tin of sealing wax.

Then, in the back of a long, narrow drawer, her fingers brushed against something smooth. She tugged, pulling out a thick leather-bound book. It was heavy and larger than she expected.

“A ledger,” she murmured, opening it.

Muriel and Cartney looked over from where they were sorting books. “What kind of ledger?” Muriel asked.

Hattie adjusted her glasses and ran her finger down the first page. The writing was precise, the ink dark and deliberate, the entries clear and evenly spaced. This was no hastily kept record—whoever maintained this had done so with care.

“Looks like… payments,” she said. “Going back twenty years.”

Muriel and Cartney moved closer.

“What kind of payments?” Cartney asked.

Hattie flipped through the pages. Each month, an amount was recorded without fail. At first, the numbers were small, but over the years, they steadily grew. The most recent entries were $500 per month with the same notation beside it: FJ/SD.

Hattie thought, then said aloud, “Maybe it stands for Father John, St. Dominic’s.”

“The church?” Muriel asked.

“I suppose.”

“So Flynn was donating to Saint Dominic’s every month? For twenty years?” Cartney asked.

Hattie studied the last entry. “Two months ago. The payments stopped just before Flynn died.” Then, something clicked in Hattie’s mind. She sat forward. “Wait a minute.”

“What?” Muriel asked.

Hattie flipped back to the most recent years. “Father John. He told me he’d been visiting Flynn every month, bringing him the sacraments.”

Muriel and Cartney exchanged glances.

“So?” Muriel asked.

“Well, maybe this is what the money was for.”Hattie ran a hand over the ledger. “Maybe it was Flynn’s way to put money into the collection basket.”

“Could be,” Cartney admitted. “But that’s a lot of money.”

Muriel shrugged. “Flynn had money coming out of his butt. What’s five hundred bucks a month for eternal salvation? Kind of a bargain.”

Hattie closed the ledger. “Well, this mystery won’t go unsolved. All we have to do is ask Father John. I’m sure it’s not a secret.”

Muriel leaned back. “Speaking of things unsolved, I talked to Lewis about the cameras.”

Hattie raised an eyebrow. “And?”

“He thinks it’s a good idea. Said that probably a ton of people have been in and out of this place. Once word got out that Flynn died, there’s a good chance someone might have come in for fun or to see if there was anything worth taking.”

Cartney nodded. “That does happen. Especially in old houses that have been sitting empty.”

Hattie tapped her fingers against the desk. “So, when do we get them?”

Muriel exchanged glances with Cartney. “I figured today. There’s no sense in waiting. The sooner we get them installed, the better.”

Cartney nodded. “Let’s go camera shopping.”

* * *

The store was a sleek, modern space with rows of shelves displaying an array of security systems. Hattie trailed behind Muriel and Cartney, scanning the options with mild apprehension. There were far more choices than she had expected—tiny wireless cameras, doorbell cameras, hidden cameras disguised as smoke detectors. The sheer variety made her head spin.

Muriel picked up a box featuring a tiny, motion-activated camera. “This one can be hidden. We don’t want to make it obvious.”

“Right,” Hattie muttered, looking at a model no larger than a matchbox. “This one says it mounts anywhere, no wires.”

Cartney was already eyeing another display. “These have night vision. We don’t know who’s coming in or when.”

Hattie frowned at the price tag. “That one’s not cheap.”

Muriel waved a dismissive hand. “It’s an investment. We shouldn’t skimp if we’re serious about keeping an eye on things.”

Hattie had no argument against that. “So we need two—one for each hallway.”

“Exactly,” Cartney said, picking up a mid-range option. “These are small enough to blend in and have decent battery life. Plus, they connect to an app so that we can check them remotely.”

Muriel took the box from her. “That settles it. Let’s get these and get back before it gets too late.”

Hattie nodded, relieved that the decision was made. As much as she understood the need for security, the whole thing left her uneasy. Something about all of this—Flynn’s ledger, the odd payments, the creeping suspicion that others had been inside the house—made her stomach twist. She just hoped the cameras would give them answers rather than more questions.


Chapter 31: Hattie Goes Rogue

After camera shopping, Hattie arrived home. The day had been exhausting but productive. She settled in with a bowl of tomato soup and a tuna fish sandwich.

While eating, she half-listened to Carol, a YouTuber currently in crisis over a missing pen.

“So I’m on my cell, and the reception is sketchy, and they’re giving me a number, and I can’t find a pen. Not my blue gel, not my black Sharpie. How have I managed? I had to be creative and reached for my nail polish. Naturally, I spilled it... and so—”

Hattie blinked at the screen, her mind already drifting. She had meant to do something online. What was it?

Then it hit her—Lainey Postman.

She tapped into Facebook and typed the name. Almost instantly, the profile popped up. Hattie scrolled up, down, and around, skimming through posts, shared articles, and curated life snippets. Then she clicked on Photos.

A mix of albums appeared—vacations, birthday gatherings, casual snapshots. She was about to move on when a particular picture caught her eye: a young woman sitting on a park bench, half-turned toward the camera.

Something about her. The tilt of her head. The way her hand rested on her lap.

Hattie leaned in. Her breath caught.

“No. It’s just my imagination,” she muttered to Orin.

But she couldn’t shake the feeling.

She pushed back her chair and went into the kitchen. On the counter sat the framed photo she’d seen so many times—Flynn as a young man standing behind his mother, who sat with a young woman on a sofa. Was this the missing link? She grabbed it and hurried back to the dining table.

Holding the framed photo next to her computer screen, she studied the two young women. Yes, there were differences, but they were remarkably similar—both seated in the same stance, the same side glance, the same relaxed elbow bent across the lap.

Hattie flipped the frame over, pried up the metal tabs, and slid the backing away. Loosened, she carefully removed the photograph to take a better look.

Something was off. Tilting the photo under the lamp, she let the light catch different angles. There, faint and almost imperceptible, was an outline—a digital manipulation, printed onto old-style photo paper to pass as genuine.

A chill swept through her. The picture had been altered. Someone had added a photo of a younger Lainey Postman.

She took a deep breath and squared her shoulders. She needed to think. To focus. Too many strange, unexplainable events—each one weirder than the last.

A montage flipped through her brain: the doctored photo, the chloroform, the stash of money, the Hustler magazine, and the people crawling around the house.

And Flynn—just dead, or murdered?

Returning to the photo—who altered it, and why? And how could Lainey Postman be in a picture with Flynn and his mother, both long deceased?

Had chloroform been used? And by whom, on whom?

The money—who hid it? A getaway fund? A bribe? Dirty cash?

And the Hustler magazine. Of all things. A guilty pleasure or a deliberate distraction? It didn’t fit. Or maybe that was the point.

And those people creeping around the house—what were they looking for? Had they been watching her? For how long?

Father John. Mike Grady. She had assumed they were on her side, but could she be sure?

Father John had secrets. That much she knew.

And Mike Grady? She wanted to trust him. But trust was a luxury she couldn’t afford.

Even Muriel was too smitten with Lewis to see straight. And Cartney wouldn’t go along with Hattie’s idea for one minute. This was something she had to figure out on her own. She had to keep secrets. If she was going off on her own—and she was—she had to be ready.

No second-guessing. No hesitation.

And that meant one thing—she needed the gun.

She opened the buffet drawer.

There it was.

Cold. Small. Heavier than she remembered.

Relief washed over her, followed by something else—unease.

Now, the real question.

Should she load it?

Her stomach twisted. Carrying the gun was one thing—loading it was another.

Hattie paced the room. Then reached back into the drawer, pulling out the small box.

Inside—a single bullet.

That was all she had.

She held it between her fingers. Stared at it. Weighed the decision.

To load it or not?

The answer came as quickly as the question.

No.

With the decision made, she turned to Orin’s picture. He gave no approval, no reassurance.

“Don’t worry,” she murmured. “I’ll be fine. It’s just precautionary.”

She slipped the gun into her purse and snapped it shut.


Chapter 32: Lewis and His Angels

“Ladies, you’ve made remarkable progress.”

They were standing by the library door when Lewis poked his head in, his expression lighter than usual. “Place looks fantastic.”

“When do you plan on selling?” Cartney asked.

He shook his head. “That’s so far in the future I might not even be alive.”

“Really?”

“Yeah. This place is a rat’s nest. And if someone’s walking around inside, that’s not good.”

Muriel adjusted her glasses. “Do you have any idea who it could be?”

“No clue,” Lewis said. “But since there’s no sign of forced entry, and the place is locked up at night, I’m guessing someone has a key. And since this house has been in the family for over a hundred years? Could be just about anybody. People come, people go. Ergo, a rat’s nest.”

Hattie exchanged a glance with Muriel who looked concerned.

Lewis clapped his hands. “Anyway, cameras are a great idea. Muriel mentioned the strange things you’ve been finding.” He let out a long sigh. “And I expect that may just be the beginning. We haven’t even touched Flynn’s lair. That could be a doozy.”

Silence.

“So, are you ladies still up for it, or is this getting too weird?”

Cartney smirked. “Weird? Have you seen my tats?”

Lewis arched a brow. “Yes. And who the heck is Sneak?”

Cartney shrugged. “The one who got away.”

“Got away from what? You? The law?”

“Yes,” she said with a wink.

“Okay then.” He turned to Muriel and Hattie. “How about you two? Still in?”

Muriel barely hesitated before nodding toward Hattie. “I go where she goes.”

All eyes turned to Hattie.

She folded her arms. “You couldn’t keep me away. And if we can’t find out who’s breaking in, I’ll break in myself.”

Lewis grinned, wide and genuine. “God bless you, ladies. So, any recent finds here in the library?”

“I did come across a ledger,” Hattie said. “We think it’s connected to Father John at St. Dominic’s.”

“Father John?” Lewis echoed.

“Yes,” Cartney said. “He showed up last week at the kitchen door. Said he spoke with you.”

Lewis frowned. “I don’t remember him.”

“He said you told him to stop by. Asked us to look for a book he loaned Flynn—some atlas.”

“There’ve been so many people,” Lewis said, gaze drifting. “Hard to keep track.”

“So what’s this ledger?” he added.

Hattie walked over to the rolltop desk and retrieved it. “It’s a record of monthly payments spanning over twenty years. Toward the end, Flynn was giving five hundred dollars each month.” She handed him the book.

Lewis flipped through the pages. “I wonder if we could find the canceled checks.”

“Would that matter?”

He nodded. “Giving to a church is pretty common, especially if you’ve got money. It’s a tax deduction, usually done by check to keep records straight.”

“From what you knew of Flynn, was he religious?” Cartney asked.

“He never talked about it. But then, he didn’t talk much.”

Muriel added, “Father John said he visited monthly to give Flynn the sacraments. Sounds like they were close.”

“Makes sense. Still...” He skimmed the ledger again. “That’s a lot of cash. Did Father John ever come back?”

“Yes, actually,” Hattie said. “He returned some of Flynn’s books and asked again about the atlas. We haven’t come across it.”

“There’s a whole other area to go through,” Lewis said. “Maybe it’ll turn up in Flynn’s quarters.” He leaned against the doorframe. “Now, about the cameras. I want one in the downstairs hall and one upstairs to cover the main walkways. If someone’s creeping around, they’ll have to pass through at least one.”

Muriel had a question. “What about outside?”

“I’ve got professionals coming to handle those. I'd rather not have hours of tree branches blowing in the wind.”

“Where outside?” Cartney asked.

“Driveway, for sure. One out back by the kitchen. Maybe another on the side of the house—to cover all the bases.”

“Sounds thorough,” Hattie said.

“Has to be. If someone’s been getting in, I want to know who and how.”

“Any chance we can view the footage?” Muriel asked.

“Sure, but I’ll monitor the outside cameras and you ladies can do the inside… We can share what we have if necessary. How does that sound?”

The women all nodded.

“Great. Install the interior cameras for the rest of the day. Tomorrow, I’ll stop by around nine, and we’ll go into Flynn’s area.”

A hush settled over them at the mention of Flynn’s space.

“Should be interesting,” Muriel finally said.

“Interesting,” Cartney echoed with a wry grin. “Or a nightmare.”

Hattie didn’t join in. She was reluctant to express any opinion about Flynn. Everything about him gave her the heebie-jeebies. With a polite smile, she followed the others as they trundled off to install the cameras.


Chapter 33: Flynn’s Room

The next day, after turning the key, Lewis hesitated at the heavy wooden door, his fingers resting on the tarnished brass knob. The others gathered behind him, waiting.

“This was Flynn’s room,” he said quietly. “Before that, it was his grandfather’s office… Ready or not, here we come.”

The door groaned as he pushed it open. A damp draft seeped out, thick with dust, mildew, and something faintly metallic. The hallway light barely touched the gloom.

Lewis found the switch, and a pale, low-voltage bulb flickered on.

Hattie stepped inside first. The remnants of a long-ago medical office still clung to the space. A cracked leather examination table, yellowed with time, leaned against the wall. Cabinets lined one side, some open, revealing books, instruments, and amber bottles.

Muriel wrinkled her nose. “Smells like ghosts and bad choices.”

Cartney nudged a stack of overturned files with her boot. “So Flynn slept here?”

Lewis nodded toward a narrow cot. “After his grandfather died, he moved in. Said it was the only part of the house that felt like his.”

They stood anchored in place. There wasn’t much room to move. Hattie ran her hand along the worn edge of a large wooden desk. Deep scratches marred its surface.

Near the bed, a tray of tarnished medical tools sat on a metal stand, neatly arranged.

Muriel stepped closer. “That’s not random.”

“No,” Lewis said. “It’s not.”

Newspapers were stacked in a column, yellowed but carefully arranged. Cartney crouched to examine one. “These are all old.”

Unlike the other rooms, this one didn’t feel forgotten. It felt lived-in. Claimed. The bed was stripped, but the pillow still held a dent, and a comforter lay bunched at one end.

Muriel ran her hand along the wall and paused near a framed photo coated in grime. She wiped it with her sleeve. “Lordy. This is Flynn as a kid.”

Hattie stepped closer. “Let me see.” She studied the familiar features—young Flynn wasn’t traditionally handsome, more smoldering, aloof, never quite looking into the camera.

Lewis shifted. “I thought about hiring a cleaning crew. But this space... It’s not just a room….” he hesitated. “We should take our time. Be respectful.”

Muriel blinked hard. “So what are we supposed to do with all this?”

“Same as the others,” Lewis said. “Bag for trash, another for donations. But—” he looked at each of them—“if you find anything estate-related, set it aside.”

Hattie gestured at the tray. “The tools?”

“Toss them. If they’re sharp, wrap them first.”

“And these medicines?” Muriel asked, pointing to the dusty bottles.

“Set them aside. I’ll ask someone how to dispose of them properly.”

Cartney moved toward a heavy wooden wardrobe at the far wall. Its doors sagged on their hinges. She ran a hand over the edge. “This thing’s solid.”

Muriel peered at it. “Maybe this is the staircase that goes up.”

Cartney tugged at the door. It creaked open. She looked inside. “Yup. Stairs.”

Lewis nodded. “A lot of these houses had double staircases.” He paused. “By the way, how’s Mike working out?”

“He’s terrific,” Muriel said. “Very helpful.”

Hattie nodded but hesitated. She liked Mike too, mostly. But something felt off—like he’d pocketed a few small things. A paperback. A mood ring. And… what was the other? She took a breath and still drew a blank. Maybe she’d ask him—no harm in that.

“And the cameras?” Lewis asked.

“Up and running,” Cartney said. “We just need to download the apps and test them.”

“Let’s do that back at Hattie’s,” Muriel said, and the others agreed.

Lewis clapped his hands. “Alrighty then. Onward, my little chickadees.”


Chapter 34: Girl Talk

After Lewis left, the women returned to the comfort of the library and the overstuffed couch. Cartney, ever patient, sat between them, effortlessly navigating their devices.

“So, let me get this straight,” Hattie said. “I can pull up my phone and see what’s going on in Flynn’s mansion from anywhere?”

“Yep,” Cartney confirmed, tapping her screen. “And Muriel can do the same. We’re linking all the cameras to this shared account so you both have access. I can check them, too.”

Muriel bit the side of her cheek. “I wonder if these cameras pick up ghosts.”

“Ghosts?” Cartney said. “How could that happen? Aren’t they invisible?”

Muriel shook her head. “Not necessarily. Ghostbusters use them all the time.”

“Seriously?”

“Uh-huh. Certainly, you’ve heard of orbs. You know those round, floaty thingies?”

Cartney shrugged. “Well, then, why not? … Anyway, I feel it’s the real people we should watch out for.”

Muriel’s face lit up. “You know what would be cool? Seeing Flynn’s ghost—then we could talk to him. We’d have to figure out the language he’d respond to. Two knocks for ‘yes’ and one for ‘no’—or should it be one for ‘yes’ and two for ‘no’? Gosh darn it, I’m already confused.”

“Muriel,” Hattie said, “let’s cross that bridge when we come to it... So, what happens if someone is in the house? Can we see them as well as hear them?”

Cartney shook her head. “We’ll only be able to see them. I didn’t want to get audio because that works both ways. If we’re watching and one of us makes a noise, it kinda blows the gig.”

“Good call. I talk to myself all the time,” Muriel said.

Cartney nodded. “Okay, you guys ready? Let’s see what we can see… Here’s the live feed from the downstairs hallway.”

Muriel leaned in, eyes widening. “Oh, it’s so… bright. Will it always look like this?”

Cartney adjusted the app settings. “That’s just the night vision. It amplifies light so we can see better in the dark.”

Hattie tapped her phone, switching to the upstairs camera. “Look at that!”

A shadow darted across the screen—fast, barely there.

Muriel sucked in a breath. “Did you see that?”

Cartney frowned, tapping the screen. “Might just be the Wi-Fi lagging. If the signal drops, the video skips frames or blurs for a second, making it look like something moved. Sometimes, it even freezes, then jumps ahead.” She paused, glancing at the screen again. “The motion sensors will send alerts if someone moves. If anyone is in there who shouldn’t be, we’ll all get a notification.”

“Hmm.” Hattie tapped the screen. “What if I’m sleeping?”

“If you don’t want to be disturbed, just turn your phone off. The alerts will be saved in the app, so you can check them whenever you wake up.”

Muriel clapped her hands. “This is exciting, you guys. If anything strange happens, we’ll know about it immediately.”

As the excitement settled, Muriel blurted out, “And let’s not forget, Hattie has her gun if things get dangerous.”

The room went silent. Cartney’s smile disappeared as she turned to face Muriel. “Wait, what?”

Muriel hesitated, realizing her mistake. “Uh—just, you know, in case of emergencies…”

Cartney folded her arms. “Hattie, tell me you’re not carrying a gun.”

Hattie shrugged. “It’s just a little one.”

“Oh, no, no, no.” Cartney shook her head. “You cannot be walking around with a gun. That’s a terrible idea.”

“I don’t keep bullets in it,” Hattie argued. “It’s more of a, let’s say, deterrent.”

“Deterrent? Hattie, you are an eighty-three-year-old woman. If someone threatens you, do you really think you’re going to pull a gun out and scare them off?”

Muriel shifted uncomfortably. “Well, I didn’t mean to bring it—”

Cartney held up a hand. “Look, I don’t like this. At all. I get wanting to be safe, but this is not the way.”

Hattie decided on a little lie. “Fine. I won’t carry it.”

Cartney looked uneasy. “Show it to me.”

“What?! Show you my gun?… Um, I don’t think so.”

Cartney glanced at Muriel, who reared back. “Maybe we sho—”

Hattie interrupted. “Cartney, it’s nothing personal, but I do believe you’ll take it. I can’t let that happen.”

“C’mon, Hattie, I just want to see it.”

A wide smile broke across Hattie’s face. Her friend’s voice was sugary sweet—too sweet. “Cartney, you’re right, I’m eighty-three years old and am quite aware of what you’ll do. I know you think it’s in my best interest, and I appreciate this, but I’m quite aware of the consequences, and I must do what feels right. So let’s drop it, okay?”

Cartney blinked hard and turned. “Muriel, what do you think?”

“Um… I’m not sure. Do you mean what do I think of the gun or of Hattie showing you the gun?”

“Either, both.”

“Well, I suspect you will take the gun if she shows it to you. On the other hand, I’m not sure the gun is a good idea either.”

Cartney nodded. “There you go. Hattie, you’re outnumbered. Hand it over. I’ll make sure you have a personal alarm before you go to bed tonight. I’ll just run over—”

“Sorry, ladies. You’re fighting a losing battle on this one. Orin told me to get a gun. End of story.”

Cartney rubbed her forehead as Muriel appeared on the verge of tears.

“I promise I won’t load it,” Hattie said.

Cartney took a deep sigh. “Scout’s honor?”

“Yes. Scout’s honor.”

“Okay, then. Ready to hit it?”

Muriel and Hattie nodded.

Cartney stood. “I have to make a pit stop before we leave. Behave yourselves.”

With Cartney out of the room, Muriel leaned toward Hattie. “Hattie, I’m sorry I brought it up. So, where is it?”

Hattie pointed.

“In your purse? Close call.”


Chapter 35: The Medicine Cabinet

They were back in Flynn’s room the following day, ready to work.

Muriel stepped up to the glass cabinet. “Look at this,” she said, pointing to the antique medical bottles. “The labels are still intact—laudanum, arsenic, morphine.” She turned to the others. “These must be from the grandfather.”

Cartney leaned in. “Laudanum—wasn’t that opium?”

Muriel nodded. “Yep. People used it for everything—pain, coughs, even to quiet fussy babies. And morphine came a little later, refined from opium. Stronger. Way more addictive.”

Cartney chuckled. “Back when medicine was just a step away from poison.”

Muriel scanned further, pointing again. “There’s arsenic and some glass vials with unmarked residue. And look at this—an old brass syringe. No way I’d trust anything out of that.”

Hattie frowned. “Why would someone keep this stuff?”

Cartney pulled out her phone. “Let’s see what we’re dealing with…” she typed, then said, “Laudanum—yep, basically opium in a bottle. Morphine—distilled and concentrated, used for surgical pain. Highly addictive, especially in the early 1900s. Arsenic—ugh. One of those ‘used in medicine but also in murder’ types. Everything from syphilis treatments to rat poison.”

“And there’s the chloroform upstairs,” Hattie added.

Cartney nodded and set her phone down. “So basically, we’ve got a house full of painkillers, poisons, and questionable cures. I say we toss the whole lot. No one needs a Victorian apothecary in their house.”

Muriel tapped her chin. “I wonder when the grandfather died? Does anyone know?”

“I can check,” Hattie said, pulling out her phone. “It might give us an idea of how old this stuff is.”

“Good idea,” Cartney said. “And while we’re at it—does any of this stuff lose its potency?”

Twenty minutes later, Cartney straightened up. “Alright, here’s what I found.” She glanced between them. “Laudanum doesn’t exactly ‘go bad.’ The alcohol preserves the opium, so even after a hundred years, it could still be active.”

Hattie grimaced. “That means it’s still dangerous.”

“Yep. If someone didn’t know what they were taking, it could knock them out—or worse.”

Muriel crossed her arms. “No wonder it was addictive. No regulations, no warnings—just a bottle of opium from your friendly corner pharmacy.”

Cartney tapped the arsenic bottle. “Now this one… it doesn’t degrade either. Even tiny amounts can be lethal.”

“Lovely,” Hattie muttered. “And people took this as medicine?”

Muriel shook her head. “Can you imagine? A little too much arsenic, and suddenly, you’re a goner.”

Cartney smirked. “And if you were diabotical, no one would suspect foul play.”

Hattie rubbed her temples. “Alright, that’s it. Let’s get it out of here.”

Muriel nodded. “Agreed. But we have to be careful. If any of it spills or gets into the wrong hands, we could have a real problem.”

“And we can’t just throw everything in the trash,” Hattie said. “Some of this stuff could be hazardous waste.”

“We should speak with Lewis,” Muriel added. “He’ll know who to call.”

Hattie nodded. “Great idea. Let’s keep this cabinet closed.”

As they left the room, Hattie’s glance fell on those darn bottles. They made her queasy.


Chapter 36: The Third Visit

When they returned to the mansion and Flynn’s room, Hattie set the plastic-wrapped box of bottles into a box. For good measure, she counted them, then taped the closed box and wrote across the top: HAZARD. It was undecided if Mike or Lewis would remove the items.

Meanwhile, Muriel had moved on to an old roll-top desk in the corner, rifling through its cluttered drawers, while Cartney pulled books from the shelves, skimming titles before stacking them into piles.

Hattie approached a trunk against the wall, its leather straps brittle with age.

“Flynn had a habit of keeping things that didn’t seem to matter,” Muriel muttered, holding up an empty, unmailed envelope. “It’s like he never threw anything away.”

“I expect it all mattered somehow,” Cartney said, wiping the dust from a book cover. “Kept him sane. Grounded, I suppose.”

Hattie flipped the trunk’s latches. Inside were yellowed newspapers and loose papers scattered like autumn leaves. She lifted the top sheet and scanned the date. Again—thirty years earlier.

What was up with this guy?

A sharp knock echoed through the room. All three women exchanged glances.

Cartney was the first to speak. “Sounds close. You think it’s the side entrance?”

Muriel’s brow furrowed. “I wonder if it’s the priest. How does that man always know where we’re working?”

“Who knows,” Cartney said, brushing off her hands. “I’ll get it.”

Hattie stayed still, listening as Cartney moved through the vestibule. A moment later, the door creaked open, and a familiar voice drifted in.

“Good day, Cartney,” Father John greeted. “I hope I’m not interrupting.”

“We’re a bit busy,” Cartney replied. “How can we help you?”

He looked past her. “Hey, Hattie, how are you today?”

“Fine. And yourself?”

“Great. I came across another one of Flynn’s books. Thought you might find it interesting.”

Hattie dusted off her palms and walked to the doorway. Father John stood just outside, holding a worn, leather-bound volume.

“Come inside,” she said. “Let’s take a look.”

Soon, the three of them were back in Flynn’s private quarters.

“So, this is where he lived?” Father John asked.

Muriel looked surprised. “You’ve never been in here?”

He shook his head. “No. I usually came in from the back. We met in the kitchen.”

Hattie found it odd. After so many years, not once in Flynn’s living space?

“We’re sorting through things,” Cartney said. “Maybe you could show Hattie the book in the library.”

“Yes. Great idea.”

In the library, Father John glanced around. “Place looks great. Find anything interesting?”

Hattie considered. “There was one thing. Flynn kept a record of his payments to you.”

“The ledger? Yes. I know it well. Flynn was generous. A wonderful parishioner.”

“We haven’t found bank records yet. Did he pay you in cash?”

“Indeed, he did. Very punctual. Every month for years. He insisted. I brought him the sacraments weekly.”

“That was nice of you.”

He scanned the room and took a deep breath. “It was the least I could do. The poor man suffered a great deal in his final years.”

“Shall we look at the book?”

“Oh, yes.” He slipped it from beneath his arm, tilting it so the gold lettering caught the light. “A theological volume. I believe there are notes in the margins—perhaps something interesting.”

“Let me grab my glasses,” Hattie said, reaching for her coat. Moments later, she returned and opened the book. No notes. She fanned through the pages. When she looked up, Father John was across the room, standing near a shelf.

Just as she was about to speak, he turned. “Oh my—did you see that?”

“See what?”

He pointed beneath the desk. “A mouse.”

“A mouse?”

He stepped over and crouched down. “Well, aren’t you the cutest little thing?”

Hattie kept her distance. “Will you be able to catch it?”

“I can try. Do you have a broom?”

“Maybe in the kitchen. Wait here.”

On her way, she poked her head into Flynn’s quarters. “There’s a mouse in the library. Keep an eye out.”

When she returned, Father John was crouched in a corner. He held a finger to his lips and pointed under a bookcase.

Muriel and Cartney appeared at the door.

“I’m surprised we haven’t seen mice before,” Cartney whispered.

“I always get them this time of year,” Muriel added. “We’ll live.”

“You’re a hardy bunch,” Father John said. “The book I brought is over there.” He pointed to a shelf near the door. “Sure you’re all alright? I could set some traps. We’ve got plenty at the rectory.”

“We’re fine,” Cartney said. “However he got in, he’ll probably find his way out.”

After he left, Hattie returned to the book, the theological volume. From her quick fan, there were no notes in the margins—just one underlined passage: For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed or hidden that will not be made known.


Chapter 37: A Little Research

While having her toast and poached egg dinner, Hattie bounced between her laptop and phone. She took a bite, balancing the phone in one hand while scrolling through her computer with the other.

The St. Dominic’s website loaded quickly. She was surprised at how polished and professional it looked—elegant yet warm, with deep blue and gold tones that gave it a timeless, almost sacred feel. A banner image stretched across the top of the page, showing the church’s grand stone façade, its stained-glass windows glowing softly in the evening light. Below, a rotating gallery showcased images of the congregation during Sunday Mass, a community picnic, and a candlelit Christmas Eve service. Someone had put real effort into it—maybe a devoted parishioner or an excellent designer.

Navigating to the “Clergy” page, she found Father John’s profile. His photo was formal but not stiff. He wore his clerical collar, but the background was warm and softly lit. He had deep-set eyes—sharp but kind—the sort of gaze that made a person feel seen. His silver-white hair was neatly combed back, revealing a strong forehead and an angular jaw softened by the weight of age. He wasn’t exactly smiling, but his expression was steady. A presence. A man who had spent decades listening more than speaking.

Beneath the image, his bio was succinct but informative:

Father John McCarthy, Pastor

Having served at St. Dominic’s for the past thirty years, Father John has become a steady figure in the parish community. Before joining the church, he studied at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and worked in historical preservation for the diocese. A lifelong student of history, he believes in the power of faith, community, and the lessons history teaches. Outside his pastoral duties, he enjoys studying antique maps and theological texts.

Hattie stared at his picture longer than she meant to. Thirty years. That was a lifetime to some. She wondered if he remembered who he was before putting on the collar.

She clicked on “Parish History” and found a well-organized section with old photographs of the church’s construction, black-and-white images of past clergy, and a timeline stretching back to the 1890s. There was even a scanned copy of the original deed. This wasn’t just a church website—it was an archive.

On the “Community” page, she found the parish’s outreach highlights: a food pantry, a literacy program, and a small emergency fund. There were blog posts, too—weekly reflections written by Father John. She scanned the most recent entry:

“Faith and history walk hand in hand. Just as we look to scripture for guidance, we must also look to the past to understand who we are. The past does not stay buried; it lives with us, shaping our choices, urging us to remember, reconcile, and seek truth.”

That stopped her. The past does not stay buried.

She exhaled, staring at the screen, when something else caught her eye: a Parish Newsletter section.

She clicked on the most recent issue. The layout was simple but well-organized, with sections for announcements, reflections, and community news. A column titled In Memoriam stood out. She skimmed the list of names until her pulse stumbled.

Flynn Elwood

Her stomach tightened. The entry was brief:

We remember Flynn Elwood, a longtime community member who passed away recently. A private man, he was known for his love of history and books. We offer our prayers for his soul and for those he leaves behind.

That was it. There was no mention of how he died, no details about service, and no words from grieving friends or family—a lifetime reduced to a few lines of polite acknowledgment.

She sat back, staring at the screen. If Father John had written this, how much had he known about Flynn? And why did it feel like an afterthought—something the church felt obliged to include but didn’t want to dwell on?

The past does not stay buried.

Hattie stared off, the weight of it all pressing against her, when an odd thought tugged at her mind—something from earlier that didn’t quite sit right.

The mouse.

She had been so sure there was one. Of course, there could have been. But now, for some reason, she wasn’t convinced. She turned and glanced at Orin’s picture across the room.

“What do you think?” she muttered.

His everlasting smile seemed particularly playful this evening.

Why had Father John gone to all that trouble if there wasn’t a mouse?


Chapter 38: Horace E. O.

Hattie sat at her kitchen table, phone in hand, scrolling through the security app. She checked it often, hoping to catch something—anything—but it was always the same: no movement, no visitors, no answers. She sighed, her finger hovering over the keypad before setting the phone down with a little more force than necessary.

Maybe this whole thing was a waste of time.

The phone lit up just as she was about to push her plate away.

Horatio.

A name that made her heart do something strange—something light.

She smiled before she even realized it. Picking up, she tried to keep her voice even. “Well, if it isn’t my favorite estate sale bandit.”

A chuckle came through the line, warm and familiar. “And here I thought I was just a misguided collector.”

Hattie leaned back in her chair, feeling her mood lift. “That too. How are things?”

Horatio sighed. “Oh, you know. Navigating uncharted waters. I spoke to Elaine again today.”

Her smile softened. Elaine. Not gone, not really, but lost in a fog—adrift, sometimes recognizing him, sometimes not.

“How was she today?”

“A little clearer,” he said. “She asked about the house, about old friends. Even remembered my brother for a moment.” He paused. “It’s... good. And hard.”

Hattie nodded, even though he couldn’t see her. “I imagine so.”

“I keep thinking I should be used to it by now,” he said, his voice quieter. “But I don’t think that ever happens. I just learn how to… ” He trailed off.

“…how to live with it?” she offered.

“Yeah.” He exhaled. “That’s about right.”

A comfortable silence settled between them—not heavy, not awkward. Just full of understanding.

Then his voice came back, lighter this time. “Anyway, I was calling to see if you’d like to have dinner sometime.”

Hattie blinked. “Dinner?”

“Yeah, you know, that thing where people sit at a table, eat food, maybe have a conversation?” His tone was teasing, but underneath it was something careful.

She huffed. “I know what dinner is, Horatio.”

“Just checking.”

A beat. She realized she hadn’t answered. “I’d like that,” she said finally.

“Great,” he said, and she could hear the smile in his voice. “What kind of food do you like?”

Hattie could say a chocolate shake with a few fries, but maybe he wouldn’t be amused. “No matter. I like all kinds of food.”

“So you’re not a vegan?”

“No.”

“Or a vegetarian?”

She wasn’t entirely sure there was a difference. “No.”

“Gluten intolerant?”

Her face twisted. Geez. This dinner invitation was more complicated than expected.

“Um… no.”

“How about food allergies?”

That did it.

“Horatio, if it’s edible, I’ll eat it.”

A pause. Then laughter. “Noted. I’ll make a plan and let you know.”

They talked a little longer—about nothing and everything—until they finally said their goodbyes. When the call ended, Hattie sat there, staring at the phone in her hand.

Dinner.

A date.

Her first in over sixty years.

God, what would she wear?

The thought struck like lightning, and suddenly, she was up, pacing, a ridiculous sense of giddiness bubbling inside her. It had been so long since she had to think about this kind of thing. Did she still have something nice? Something that didn’t say old lady in comfortable shoes?

She caught her reflection in the hallway mirror and stopped, startled.

For the first time in a long time, she didn’t just see herself—she saw a woman on the edge of something new.

And she liked it.

Hattie wrapped her arms around herself, grinning like a kid with a crush.

Should she tell Muriel?

The thought made her pause. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to—it was that she had a secret for the first time in ages. A sweet, silly secret all her own. Something to tuck away and hold close for a little while.

She’d tell Muriel eventually.

But for now?

For now, this moment was hers.


Chapter 39: WTF

At eleven at night, Hattie’s phone buzzed.

Groggy and suddenly concerned, she thought of Howie. She fumbled for her glasses and squinted at the screen.

Not a call. A text.

Camera App Notification: Motion Detected.

Her pulse quickened. She tapped the alert, and grainy black-and-white footage filled the screen. At first—nothing. Just the still image of the front hallway. Then, movement. A shadow passed along the lower edge of the frame.

A man.

Hattie sat up, bumping Lucy off the bed. She switched to the upstairs landing camera.

There he was.

A figure emerged from the stairwell, moving slowly, deliberately. He was of average height—maybe taller—but it was hard to tell. His face was hidden, and his head was angled downward. He wore a long, heavy coat and a hat with a curved brim that shadowed his features. It was not a baseball cap—something older.

For a moment, Hattie wondered if it was Mike. Or even Father John. In some ways, that would be a relief.

Then he turned slightly—just enough for her to glimpse his face.

She didn’t recognize him.

A chill spread through her.

The man reached the end of the hall and, without hesitation, stepped into Mrs. Flynn’s bedroom. The door closed behind him.

Hattie stared at the screen. Rewound the footage. Watched it again. And again.

Who the hell was he? And why that room?

Her phone rang. She jumped, nearly dropping it.

Muriel.

She answered. “Are you up?”

“Yes.”

“Did you see him?”

“Yes.”

Silence.

Muriel’s voice wavered. “Who the hell is this guy?”

“No clue.”

“What should we do?”

“I don’t know,” Hattie said, still staring at the image frozen on her screen.

“I can’t wait around. This is freaking me out,” Muriel said. “I’ll call Lewis and tell him to download the app so he can see the picture. I’ll call you right back.”

“Yes. Don’t worry about the time.”

Hattie tapped replay again. The man moved with purpose—no hesitation, no confusion. Like he knew exactly where he was going.

She pinched the screen to zoom in.

The coat—long and heavy. Wool, maybe. Dark. Possibly black. The collar—high cut. Double-breasted?

His hands—bare. Long fingers. Prominent knuckles.

Shoes—polished leather. Not sneakers. Not work boots. Something refined.

Hattie sat back, exhaling. “Well, Lucy,” she muttered as the cat jumped back onto the bed. “I have no clue who the hell he is.”

Lucy blinked slowly and began kneading the blanket, unbothered.

Hattie wasn’t so lucky.

She pressed play again.

The hat. That damn hat. It bothered her. Not modern. Not like the baseball caps Howie wore or the knit beanies kids pulled down over their ears in winter.

This one was older. A fedora? A homburg?

She exhaled, scratching Lucy’s head. “This isn’t helping, is it?”

Lucy purred.

Hattie glanced at the time. When was Muriel going to call back?

Restless, she scrolled the footage back to the very start. Had she missed something? Had he been outside before this? Watching? Waiting?

The house creaked.

She froze, the phone still in hand.

Just the wind. Nothing more.

She looked at Lucy, who hadn’t even twitched an ear.

“If you’re not worried, I shouldn’t be, right?”

Lucy flopped onto her side, tail flicking once.

Hattie sighed. “Then why do I have a bad feeling about this?”

Her phone buzzed. She jolted upright.

Muriel.

Hattie answered. “Okay, Muriel, what did Lewis say?”

Her friend was out of breath. “Oh, Hattie. This is bad, really bad.”

“Calm down. Tell me what he said.”

“His name is Winston Barr. He’s a developer.”

Hattie blinked. “Developer?”

“He owns a company—Ravenwood Development Group.”

Ravenwood. The name rang a bell. She closed her eyes and pictured gold lettering on a glass building downtown.

“Lainey Postman,” she whispered. “That’s the building she went into.”

“Yes.”

“What did Lewis say when you told him that?”

“That’s the big problem,” Muriel said. “How do I tell him I know that building without admitting we were spying on him?”

Hattie collapsed against her pillow. “Geez. This is a mess.” She rubbed her forehead. “Okay, listen. We stay calm. We talk to Cartney. She’ll know what to do.”

“He’s going to dump me,” Muriel said, her voice breaking. “And I can’t blame him. I’m completely screwed.”

“No, you’re not,” Hattie said. “I’ll take the blame. I’ll say it was my idea. I showed you the app, remember? I told you how to track his location.”

Muriel sniffled. “You’d do that?”

“Of course.”

Hattie sighed, glancing at the paused image of Winston Barr.

“But that doesn’t mean I’m not pissed.”

“At me?” Muriel asked.

“No. At Lewis.”

Silence.

Hattie sat up straighter. “Why couldn’t he just tell you about that woman? Why be so secretive?”

Muriel didn’t answer.

Hattie could picture her friend—chewing a nail, trying to think of a reason. Finally, Muriel said, “I don’t know, Hattie.”

Hattie stared at the screen. At the figure in the hallway. At the shadows that refused to leave.


Chapter 40: Winston Barr

After hanging up, Hattie—now wide awake—decided to check out Mr. Winston Barr.

He was easy to find. He seemed to have it all as an entrepreneur, real estate mogul, and remarkably handsome man. Originally from Canada, he’d invested in the town for thirty years. Once a Rust Belt city, her hometown was now in full growth mode.

Hattie scrolled through articles, interviews, and real estate listings tied to his name. Barr wasn’t just a developer—he was the developer—the man behind every gleaming high-rise, every revitalized block, every boutique hotel in the past decade. The papers called him a visionary, a risk-taker who’d seen potential when others had written the town off.

“Uh-huh,” Hattie muttered, clicking deeper. The praise felt too polished. Too controlled.

A few more searches turned up less flattering details. Lawsuits over zoning disputes. Accusations of displacing longtime residents. A few abandoned projects, now overgrown lots. Nothing outright criminal—at least, not that she could find—but enough to raise an eyebrow.

And then there were the photos.

One caught her attention—an older image grainy but unmistakable—Winston Barr, standing beside Flynn.

Her breath caught. What was he doing with Flynn?

She enlarged the photo, studying their faces. Barr looked confident, mid-laugh, in a tailored suit. Flynn, tight-lipped and turned slightly away, seemed uncomfortable. A business meeting? A pitch? Was Barr trying to buy Flynn’s property?

Hattie opened a new search tab and typed Winston, Lainey.

Nothing.

Then: Lainey Postman and Ravenwood Development Group.

Still nothing.

Then she had an idea. She switched to image search.

Suddenly, the screen flooded with photos.

She leaned in, scrolling faster now.

The first image was a sleek promo shot—Barr posed in front of a glass high-rise, arms crossed, a designer watch peeking from under a cuff. The caption read: Visionary Builder: The Man Who Changed a City.

The second—Barr at a groundbreaking, gold shovel in hand, wide smile. Behind him was a crumbling building, soon to be rubble.

The third—at a charity gala, the ballroom drenched in golden light. Barr raised a glass in the foreground. Near the edge of the frame, just barely visible—Flynn.

Hattie’s pulse quickened.

She clicked the next image—a group in a parking lot, mid-conversation. Barr again, in a dark coat, gesturing animatedly. Flynn, wary, stood beside him. But it was the woman in the photo who held Hattie’s gaze.

She looked like Lainey Postman. Same cheekbones. Same sharp eyes. But the hair was dark and short.

She leaned back. “Jeez. Who the heck is this chameleon?” Then it hit her, of course, an actor.

Her phone buzzed, cutting through her thoughts. It was Cartney.  Coming over in the morning. We need to talk and meet with Lewis.

Hattie exhaled and set her phone down. Yes, they needed to meet. This was getting too crazy.

And behind her eyes, a dull ache was building.


Chapter 41: Intervention with Muriel

“Okay,” Cartney said. “We need to figure out how to talk to Lewis without making a big deal about spying on him. That ship has sailed.”

Hattie glanced at Muriel. Poor thing looked completely unraveled—no bright smile, just slumped shoulders and worry lines.

“Honey,” Hattie said gently, “why not try one of these pastries Cartney brought over? Almond—your favorite.”

Muriel stared off, fingers tracing the rim of her teacup. “I’m fine, thank you.”

Hattie and Cartney exchanged a look.

“Alright,” Cartney continued, keeping her tone steady. “Let’s stay calm and clear about what we know—and what we’re asking.”

“He’ll never speak to me again,” Muriel blurted.

“Yes, you keep saying that,” Cartney said evenly. “But how do you know? Let’s try to be optimistic. Besides, Hattie offered to take the blame.”

“I can’t let her do that.”

“But Muriel, it was my fault. I showed you how to use the app.”

Muriel shook her head. “You didn’t tell me to spy. You kept saying I should talk to him.”

Hattie met Cartney’s eyes again. This was deeper than they thought.

“Listen,” Cartney said, “we’ll meet with him. Muriel, you don’t have to come. Hattie and I can handle it.”

“Yes,” Hattie said. “Of course.”

Muriel sat up straighter. “I’m going. I need to.”

Cartney nodded. “Alright. Here’s what we know: Winston Barr was in the house. That’s big. Why?”

Hattie leaned forward. “He has a key.”

“And he went into Flynn’s mother’s bedroom. Why? Was he looking for something—or planting something?”

Hattie blinked. Until now, she’d focused on what he was doing there, not why. Then it clicked. “Maybe he wasn’t searching—maybe he was planting something.”

Cartney’s eyes sharpened. “Like what?”

“Remember the photo that was on the nightstand? The one I took to compare with others? Well… I did a little digging online.”

Her friends leaned in.

“I wasn’t sure how you’d take this,” Hattie said, glancing at Muriel. “But I’d like your input.”

Hattie disappeared, then returned to the table with the framed photo in hand.

“Once we had her name, I looked up Lainie Postman. Didn’t get far—until I found her archived photos. There’s one of her, probably from high school.” Hattie opened her laptop. A couple of clicks, and the image filled the screen.

“Okay,” she said. “Now before I say anything, look at this photo from the mansion and the one on Lainie’s Facebook page. See anything familiar?”

Cartney and Muriel leaned in, eyes darting between the two images.

“Holey moley,” Cartney said. “What the eff?”

They turned to Muriel.

She was shaking her head. “I don’t understand. I don’t get it. Jeez, what is wrong with me?”

“Now, Muriel,” Hattie said, voice gentle. “Stop putting yourself down. Take your time.”

Muriel nodded. Her eyes flitted between the photos again. Then suddenly—recognition.“Who the friggin’ fried cakes is this person?”

“Exactly,” Hattie and Cartney said in unison.

“So… Lainie and Flynn are related?”

Hattie shrugged. “Maybe, maybe not. But from what I can tell, the photo’s been manipulated. Someone inserted Lainie’s old picture into a photo of Flynn and his mother.”

Cartney sat back, stunned. “We need to show it to Lewis.”

Muriel gripped her teacup.

Hattie nodded. “Good idea.”

“But if we bring it up,” Muriel said softly, “won’t Lewis realize I was spying on him?”

“Muriel, yes—we spied on him,” Hattie said firmly. “But let’s not forget, he’s the one who ghosted you after making plans.”

Muriel didn’t answer.

Then Cartney leaned forward. “Wait—what if Lewis already knows all this? What if he’s in on it?”

“In on what?” Hattie asked.

“The scam,” Cartney said. “Trying to get the property.”

Muriel gasped. “No.” She sat bolt upright, the defeated look gone. “That’s impossible. Lewis would never do something like that.”

Hattie hesitated. She wanted to believe it for Muriel’s sake, but he was being kind secretive about meeting with Lainey.

“Muriel, I know you care about him. But we don’t know what Lewis is involved in. Maybe he’s being played, like the rest of us. Or maybe…”

“No.” Muriel’s voice was steady now. “Lewis isn’t like that. I need to hear it from him.”

Cartney glanced at Hattie. The shift was clear—Muriel wasn’t afraid anymore. She was ready for answers.

“Then we ask the right questions,” Cartney said. “If Lewis has been misled, he’ll understand. If not—”

Muriel lifted her chin. “Then I’ll know he’s not the man I thought he was.”


Chapter 42: Intervention with Lewis

“So, ladies, where should we start?” Lewis looked at each woman directly.

Cartney dove in. “How do you know this Winston Barr guy?”

He took a deep breath and shook his head. “He’s my nemesis. Never takes no for an answer. Been bugging me for years about Flynn’s property. Total jerk wad. But... he knows people and has thrown a lot of business my way.”

“Were you surprised he was in the building last night?” Cartney asked.

“Surprised? Yeah, I couldn’t believe it. But he’s never been the most ethical guy. He wants that place badly. A lot of people do.”

Hattie leaned in. “I think the locks should be changed.”

“No question. I already called someone. They’ll be out in soon. I’ll let you know once it’s done so I can give you the new keys.”

“So we shouldn’t go back until then?” she asked.

“Definitely not.”

“And what about the cameras?”

“Keep them. I can’t guarantee who’ll be coming in or out—or why.”

“Have you spoken with him?” Cartney asked.

Lewis exhaled and gave a short laugh. “The good news is, I’ve got something on him. Maybe I can use it to my advantage.”

Hattie didn’t like the sound of that. Could Lewis and Winston be on the same side?

“What’s the status of the outside cameras?” Muriel asked.

“Same timeframe. I figure the place will be secured in two days.”

“So we wait?” Cartney asked.

He nodded. “Yes.” He glanced around the desk. “Is there anything else?”

Muriel and Cartney looked to Hattie. She felt a jolt of adrenaline.

“Actually, yes. I found something you’ll want to see.” She reached into a plastic bag and pulled out the old photograph of Mrs. Elwood, Flynn, and the young woman, then slid it across the desk.

Lewis reached for his glasses. “Hmm. What do we have here?”

“It was on the nightstand in Mrs. Flynn’s bedroom,” Hattie said. “It stood out—it’s not like any of the others in the library.”

He brought the photo closer to his face. “Not like them, how?”

“It’s the only one with that young woman in it.”

His brow furrowed. “Really?”

Hattie glanced at Muriel and Cartney, then asked, “Does she look familiar?”

After a long pause, he said, “Yes.” He rubbed his chin, seemingly lost in thought.

Muriel looked like she might cry.

Cartney stepped in. “Who is she?”

“She looks like a younger version of someone I know.” He hesitated. “Her name is Lainey Postman. She says she’s Flynn’s half-sister.”

“You don’t believe her?” Cartney asked.

He raised his hands. “Some days, yes. Some days, no.”

The room went still. Hattie decided to rip off the bandage. “We’ve found this same woman in photos with Winston Barr.”

Lewis sat back, rolled his head, and muttered, “Oh my god.”

He let out a long breath. “Well. That explains that.” He leaned forward. “Ladies, you are getting a raise. A big fat one. I’ve been played for a fool—but not anymore.”

Hattie braced for the inevitable question: How did you know I knew Lainey Postman? But it didn’t come. To keep him from getting there, she redirected. “What’s the story with this woman?”

“Lainey? She answered an ad I ran in the paper. I have to show diligence when looking for heirs—she responded.”

“Did anyone else come forward?” Hattie asked.

He chuckled. “Let’s see... A chimney guy claimed Flynn owed him fifty grand for repointing three chimneys. I hired another contractor to check it out. None of the chimneys had been touched. Claim denied.”

“Wow,” Cartney said.

“Then a woman said she and Flynn got married in college but never divorced. She figured she was entitled to half the estate. The problem was there was no marriage certificate. And Flynn never told me he’d been married. Claim denied.”

Muriel raised an eyebrow. “Anyone else?”

Lewis grinned. “Oh yeah. One woman brought me a napkin contract, supposedly signed by ‘Flynn’s Astral Self.’ Said it was legally binding since spirits transcend time. I told her I only deal in legal documents. Denied.”

“So Lainey seemed the most legit?” Hattie asked.

“She provided everything I asked for—photos, letters, birth certificate. She said she was Flynn’s half-sister on her mother’s side. The more I pressed, the more she came up with. But now I realize—she wasn’t working alone. She’s with Winston.”

“What are you going to do?” Hattie asked.

“I’m not sure.”

“Have you tried matching Flynn’s DNA with hers?” Muriel offered. “Since they share a mother, it should be pretty clear.”

Lewis turned to her, surprised. “Muriel, how do you know this stuff?”

“TV,” she said. “You could get Flynn’s DNA from that gross pillowcase still in his room.”

“It hasn’t been tossed?”

Muriel shook her head. “No one will touch it. We’re waiting for Mike. And there’s all kinds of DNA in his mother’s room—perfume bottles, creams, lotions.”

Lewis nodded slowly. “That might actually work.”

Muriel beamed. “And when you take Lainey to lunch, you can test her glass or utensils.”

Hattie stopped breathing. She glanced at Cartney, who lowered her face to hide a smile.

Lewis arched an eyebrow. “When I take her to lunch?”

Muriel froze. “Did I say when?”

“Yes.”

“Silly me. I meant if you take her to lunch.”

Lewis chuckled. “Yes—capital idea. You are one sharp moon pie.” He turned to Cartney and Hattie. “Isn’t she grand?”

They nodded in agreement.


Chapter 43: An Arresting Development

Hattie felt energized. She hadn’t slept so well in months, and after breakfast, she put on her heavy shoes to see if her perennials were popping.

She pulled on a sweater at the kitchen door and stepped onto the damp grass. The refreshing chill of early spring clung to the morning air. She walked her usual path along the garden’s edge, scanning the soil—and there they were. Little splashes of color—purple, yellow, striped—pushing through the earth. Her tiny warriors against winter’s last grasp had survived.

She crouched down, running a fingertip along the delicate petals. “Well, look at you,” she murmured, smiling. “Right on time.”

She lingered. A robin flitted past, its song bright and clear. Overhead, a jet traced a line across the sky. Everything felt unusually alive. She breathed in the deep, hopeful scent of earth.

Her eyes roamed the garden’s edge, scanning for more signs of spring, but all she spotted was a curled slug on a stone. She flicked it away. “Not today, buddy. Not on my watch.”

She was about to head inside for her second cup of coffee when she heard the crunch of tires on gravel. A car pulling in. Odd.

Hattie stood, squinting toward the road.

A police cruiser.

Her first thought was that they were just turning around. That happened sometimes. But the car stopped, and an officer stepped out. “Mrs. Moon?” she called, approaching.

“Yes. How can I help you?”

The officer, a woman in her thirties, stopped a respectful distance away. “Do you know Detective Ted Blansky?”

Hattie blinked. “Ted? Well, yes, quite well. Why do you ask?”

“He’d like to speak with you down at the station.”

“Station?” Hattie echoed with a smile.

“Yes. Would that be a problem?”

She shook her head. “No. Can I ask why?”

“I’m sorry. I’m just driving today.”

With no plans for the day, Hattie’s curiosity flared. She loved surprises. “Say,” said Hattie, “should we pick up some donuts on our way? He loves those Bavarian Creams.”

The officer shrugged. “Not necessary. We get two dozen delivered every morning.”

“Yummy.” Hattie leaned in and whispered, “Anyway, if this is about that business with the garden gnome, I can explain everything.”

The officer blinked, then cracked a smile. “I’ll be sure to let Detective Blansky know.”

Hattie glanced toward the house. “Okey dokey. I need to change my shoes.”

“Of course. Take your time.”

* * *

The station hadn’t changed much since Hattie’s last visit, which, if she remembered right, involved a bake sale fundraiser and a missing cat poster. Today, no cupcakes. No tabbies.

The officer led her through the side door, nodded politely to the desk sergeant, and guided her to a small interview room with chairs that didn’t invite lingering.

“I’ll let him know you’re here,” she said, gently closing the door behind her.

Hattie took a seat. Touching base with Ted again would be fun.

The door opened, and in walked Detective Ted Blansky: same stocky frame, same tired eyes. The poor man always looked like they’d seen too much and didn’t enjoy the view. He carried a manila folder and a cup of coffee.

“Mrs. Moon,” he said, almost fondly. “You’re aging backward.”

“Tell that to my knees,” she replied.

He chuffed out a laugh.

“So what’s all this about, Ted? I got perennials popping out there. I don’t usually interrupt my garden unless someone’s dead or offering free pie.”

Blansky smiled faintly and set the folder on the table. “Appreciate you coming in,” he said. “This is… sensitive.”

Hattie raised an eyebrow. “Sensitive? Sounds intriguing.”

He chuckled, then got serious. “This came across my desk. Something in it raised a red flag, and your name came up. I figured it was better to talk in person.”

He finally opened the folder. Hattie leaned forward, but he didn’t slide it over yet.

“Before I show you anything,” he said, “do you know Father John?”

Hattie nodded. “The priest at St. Dominic’s? Yes. Why do you ask? Is he alright?”

Blansky opened the folder, glanced inside, then closed it again. His gaze leveled on her.

“Mrs. Moon,” he said, “do you have a gun?”

Hattie blinked. A gun? Uh-oh. She pulled herself together. “Well, that depends. Are we talking metaphorically? Because I’ve got a sharp tongue and a mean look that I can weaponize on short notice.”

Blansky didn’t laugh. He waited.

She cleared her throat. “You’re serious?”

“I am.”

She sat back in her chair. “Oh, fine. Technically, yes. It was a gift from a gentleman friend. And it's really more decorative than dangerous. Like a paperweight, but with flair.”

Blansky raised an eyebrow. “Does this paperweight happen to be loaded?”

“Goodness, no!” she said, scandalized. “Who do you think I am, Mata Hari… Wait—did she have a gun?”

Unamused, he leaned forward. “Where is it now?”

That gave her pause. She glanced down at her purse and made a decision. “I don’t carry it around,” she lied. Her voice was light—too light. Gosh darn it, Hattie. You’ve always been a terrible liar.

Blansky said nothing. He opened a desk drawer and pulled out a clear plastic evidence bag containing a small, pearl-handled derringer. He laid it on the table.

“Does this look familiar?”

Hattie’s heart did a slow, confused somersault. She glanced at the gun, then looked away and back again. By God, it did look familiar. But it couldn’t be.

She forced a laugh. “Well, lots of little guns look like that. That’s the whole point of little guns—they’re generic.”

Blansky didn’t blink.

She sighed. “Alright. It looks like mine. But it can’t be. Mine’s in my purse.” There it was—out of the bag. Lordy.

“Mind if I see it?”

“Sure,” she said, unzipping her bag, smug in her certainty.

Tissues. Mints. A crumpled receipt from McDonald’s. A leather-bound copy of Don Quixote.

No gun.

She paused, dug deeper, and lifted her wallet, a notepad, and eyeliner she had never figured out how to use.

Still no gun.

“Well,” she said faintly. “This is awkward.”

Blansky folded his arms. “You want to tell me how your not-in-your-purse gun ended up abandoned in a public park?”

Hattie reared back. What started as English was now gibberish. She felt disoriented.

“Whoa, whoa—hold your horses.” She held up both hands. “You’re throwing a whole fruit salad at me. Was it loaded?”

He nodded.

Hattie rubbed her temple. “I’m a bit confused. My gun was in my purse. It had been there a while.” She looked at the bagged derringer. “Are you sure that’s mine?”

“We traced the serial number. It was sold in an estate sale to Mr. Ogg. We contacted him.”

“Oh,” she managed.

Blansky gave her a long look—one of those weary, measured stares she knew well.

“Mrs. Moon, I need you to understand something. In this state, carrying an unregistered, loaded firearm—especially outside your home—is a felony.”

She opened her mouth, then closed it.

“I know you didn’t fire that weapon. But the fact is, the loaded gun was registered to you—sort of—and it’s not licensed. That alone could carry serious charges. Three and a half years, minimum, if the DA wanted to press it.”

Hattie swallowed. “But I didn’t load it. I never put bullets in that thing. I promised Horatio, Mr. Ogg, that I wouldn’t!”

“You’re saying Horatio gave you the gun?”

“Yes. But he never loaded it, and neither did I.”

Blansky held up a hand. “Doesn’t matter. If someone took it, loaded it, and used it—well, that’s where things get worse.”

Hattie’s eyes narrowed. “Used it how?”

Blansky slid the bag slightly forward.

“It wasn’t just found abandoned in a park. That was the second scene. The first was at a church. Someone used this gun to fire two rounds at Father John. He’s fine—but he could’ve been killed.”

Hattie pressed a hand to her chest. “Good Lord.”

“And then it was found ditched under a bench at Lawson Park.” He leaned in. “That means your gun wasn’t just missing—it was used in the commission of a crime.”

She stared at the bagged derringer like it might bite. “Well,” she said faintly, “this just took a hard left.”

Blansky studied her, then asked, “Have you been trained to use a firearm?”

Hattie sat up straighter. “No. Of course not.”

“Ever fired one before?”

“Never. Not once. I didn’t even like squirt guns as a kid.”

Blansky tapped the table with two fingers. “Did you try to shoot Father John?”

Her whole body recoiled. “What? Ted! Are you kidding me?”

“I’m asking,” he said, calm and unreadable. “Because whoever did it didn’t know what they were doing. The angle was wrong. Two shots went into the doorframe. Like someone closed their eyes and hoped for the best.”

Hattie opened her mouth, then shut it. “Yikes,” she muttered. “Does the fact that I don’t know how to use a gun make me look more guilty?” She rubbed her temples. “This is a rat’s nest. A full-blown rat’s nest with extra rats. Ted, I didn’t shoot anyone. I didn’t try to shoot anyone. I didn’t even know the gun was missing.”

Blansky leaned back. “Then we need to figure out who did.”

She stared at him wide-eyed. “Well, you’re the detective.”

“And you’re the one with the missing gun,” he said. “So think. Who knew you had it? Who had access to your purse?”

Hattie went still. Names fluttered across her mind. Cartney. Muriel. Horatio.

“Maybe I need a lawyer,” she said. “Yes. I believe I do.”


Chapter 44: No, Not Howie!

The coffee in the paper cup had gone lukewarm, but Hattie kept sipping it—something to do with her hands and keep her from pacing. The room had all the warmth of a root cellar: cinderblock walls painted the color of oatmeal and fluorescent lights that hurt her eyes.

She tried to breathe deeply, but her chest felt tight.

Loaded gun.

Public park.

Fired at a priest.

All very not on her to-do list.

A soft knock on the door. Then it opened, and Blansky stepped in.

“Before you call for a lawyer, your son’s here.”

Hattie blinked. “You called Howie?”

“He’s your emergency contact.”

“Well, I meant for emergencies,” she muttered—just as Howie appeared behind Blansky.

Hattie slapped on her sugary, sweet smile. “Sweetheart,” she said with forced cheer, “how nice of you to drop by.”

Howie’s expression looked… overcooked. Pale and tight and slightly burned at the edges.

“Well, I’ll leave you two alone,” Blansky said, stepping aside and closing the door.

“Ma,” Howie said, drawing out the word like it weighed something. “How did it go from eating dumplings to discussing ballistics?”

Hattie straightened in her chair. “Honey, we aren’t discussing anything. I’m just sitting here like a perfect citizen with cold coffee and a firearm I didn’t know was missing.”

Howie shook his head and sat. “A gun, Mom? You had a gun?”

“Now, Howie, let’s not go ballistic. I may have had a gun, but it was decorative and ornamental for all practical purposes. Like something you’d hang on a Christmas tree if you weren’t quite in the spirit.”

He rubbed his temples. “Jesus. Where’d you get it?”

“I don’t think that’s important. So, let’s skip this part of the conversation.”

“No, Ma. We’re not skipping this conversation. We have to discuss what the hell happened here. Did Cartney talk you into this?”

Hattie reared back. “Cartney!? Actually, she was completely against it.”

He took a deep breath. “Finally, someone who’s sane… So you and Muriel cooked this up?”

Hattie shook her head. “Howie, it was my idea. Nobody else’s.”

“Great. Just great… Now that’s what I’m talking about.”

She didn’t like the sound of that. “What do you mean?”

“Your judgment, Ma. Getting a gun is terrible judgment. Luckily, you’re still alive. Geez, the damn thing could have blown up in your purse.”

“Howie, that couldn’t have happened. It wasn’t loaded.”

He looked at her stone-faced. “If you’re carrying around an unloaded gun, what’s the point?”

Her jaw tightened. She looked away.

“Don’t you see? It’s another sign of questionable thinking.” His tone was even, but it carried weight.

Suddenly, Hattie felt trapped. “Howie, you’re not putting me anywhere.”

“Huh? That’s not what I said.”

“But it’s what you’re thinking. You’re always thinking about it. Whenever I forget a dentist appointment or ask where I put the vanilla extract, you give me that look.”

“Ma—”

“You’re doing it right now!”

Silence. Thick and itchy.

Then, softer: “I’m scared.”

She turned to him. “Well, I’m scared too, Howie. I’m scared because someone took that gun. Someone fired it. And now you’re sitting here acting like I’m the problem.”

He looked at her for a long moment. “You should’ve told me about the gun.”

“You would’ve taken it away.”

“You’re damn right I would’ve.”

Her breath caught, but she held his gaze.

Finally, he leaned back. “Okay,” he said. “Okay. You didn’t shoot anyone. So what now?”

Before she could answer, the door opened, and Blansky reentered.

He flicked his gaze toward Howie, then looked at Hattie. “Your friend’s here. We’ll let you two talk.”

“What friend?”

“Horatio.”

Oh shit, Hattie thought.

Blansky clapped Howie lightly on the shoulder. “Let’s grab some coffee before we figure out what to do next.”


Chapter 45: No, Not Horatio!

Hattie listened carefully for approaching steps when the door finally swung open, and Horatio entered with Blansky in tow.

“Okay, I’ll leave you two alone. Behave yourselves.”

The door shut, leaving Horatio standing in front of her, hands in his pockets and a smirk on his face.

“We meet again. So, who’s going to take the rap on this? I’d volunteer, but I hear the food in this joint kinda sucks.”

Hattie couldn’t help but smile. “I’m sorry about this. Are you in trouble?”

His eyes brightened as he laughed. “No. It got me out of the house when they asked me to come down. And I was intrigued. I love being intrigued.”

“Did you have to leave Specks?”

“No way. He’s in the car. I told him we’d be picking up a treat.”

Horatio shifted his weight and glanced casually at the corners of the ceiling as if checking for cameras.

“So... wanna tell me what happened? Not that I don’t trust these fine folks to keep me in the loop, but let’s say communication hasn’t been their strong suit.”

Hattie hesitated. “Well. The gun. The derringer. It went missing.”

His smirk faded just a hair. “Missing as in... lost under your seat? Or missing like someone used it for a magic trick and forgot to bring it back?”

She didn’t answer right away. “Well, um... kinda borrowed it, shot at someone, then dropped it in a park.”

His eyebrows crinkled. “Oops.”

“Luckily, no one was hurt.”

He looked toward the door, then back at her with that same easy smile—now strained at the edges. “Good. So, no harm done, right? It’s just a missing bauble. Happens all the time.”

“They think I fired it at someone.”

Horatio blinked, then chuckled softly. “Well. That’s a twist. What’d you do, shoot someone’s pride?”

“I wish.”

He stepped closer and sat across from her. “Look, I don’t want to be paranoid, but... they’re probably recording this.”

“I know. Did you speak with them?”

“I did.”

“What did they ask you?”

“They wanted to know why I gave you a gun. I told them you were looking for a very special one.” He smiled. “Specifically, it had to look like the state of Idaho because it was a missing puzzle piece that was a message from your deceased husband…” He leaned forward. “I don’t think they believed me.”

Hattie laughed. “I’m sure they think I’m nuts... I suppose I may be.”

He shook his head. “Whatever. It made perfect sense to me... So what’s going to happen? You in for forty years?”

“They said something about a felony being committed.”

“Felony? Is this your first?”

Hattie nodded.

“Well, then... Listen. If they let you go home—and I assume they will because you don’t exactly scream hardened criminal—how about dinner tomorrow, say around six? I’ll pick you up. You name the place.”

Hattie blinked. “Dinner? I... I don’t know what’s happening yet.”

He gave her a soft smile. “That’s alright. If you can’t make it, just let me know.” He winked. “We won’t go anywhere with metal detectors.”

She chuckled, then wondered—or maybe worried—if Howie was watching and what he’d be thinking.

“Do you have a ride home?”

“My son’s here. Thank you.”

Horatio perked up. “Do you want me to meet him?”

Hattie’s heart skipped a beat. “Do you want to meet him?”

“Sure. I like meeting people. I’m good at handshaking and slapping a smile on my face. You’ll be proud of me.”

She gave him a warm, slightly bewildered smile. “You’re not like anyone I’ve ever met.”

“I hope that’s a good thing.”

“I haven’t decided yet.”

The door rattled, and Blansky peeked in. “You two done conspiring?”

Horatio stood. “Yes, Officer. It’s about risotto.”

Blansky muttered, “Lord help me,” and opened the door wider for Howie.

Her son stood in the doorway, eyebrows raised, his jacket half-zipped, and his expression somewhere between worried and weary. He looked from Hattie to Horatio and back again.

Horatio turned to him with an easy smile and extended his hand. “You must be Howie. I’ve heard... well, nothing, actually, but I assume you’re a wonderful son.”

Howie blinked, then slowly shook his hand. “And you are...?”

“Horace Elton Ogg, but I prefer Horatio. Gentleman, occasional gardener, and aspiring dinner date.”

Howie looked at his mother. “Dinner date?”

Hattie cleared her throat. “He, uh, helped me. With something.”

“She means I gave her a gun that may or may not resemble Idaho. Long story. Mostly fictional. You had to be there.”

Howie looked back at Horatio as if he was still deciding if the man was dangerous or just mildly unhinged.

“I’m still trying to decide if I’m allowed to go home,” Hattie said.

“Well,” Howie glanced toward the hallway, “Ted said you’ll likely be released. Something about paperwork and a ‘hefty warning.’”

Horatio rubbed his hands together. “Fantastic. So we’re back to dinner.”

Howie folded his arms. “Where would this dinner be, exactly?”

Horatio smiled. “Wherever your mother chooses. I’m flexible. Italian? Thai? Pancake house with questionable lighting?”

“I like the pancake house,” Hattie offered.

“She has excellent taste,” Horatio said, rolling his eyes.

Howie sighed. “You two are... something.”

“Thank you,” Horatio replied cheerfully.

Hattie raised an eyebrow at her son. “You still driving me home?”

“Of course.”

“Great,” Horatio headed for the door. “I’ll just follow behind you. Like a gentleman stalker.”

Howie looked alarmed.

“Kidding!… I’ll be off. Have a nice evening.”

With Horatio gone, Howie muttered, “I can’t believe this is happening.”

Hattie patted his arm. “Neither can I, dear. Isn’t it wonderful?”


Chapter 46: Baileys, Whiskey, Chocolate

Hattie opened the kitchen door to find Muriel standing there, her breath puffing in the cold air, arms folded tight across her chest.

“Where have you been?” Muriel asked. “Ralph said he saw a police car in your driveway. What the fudge nuts is going on?”

Hattie stepped aside to let her in. “Someone stole my gun and tried to shoot someone else,” she said, adding with exaggerated bravado, “No biggie.”

Muriel froze. “Excuse me?”

“Come in. I’ll get the Baileys.”

Moments later, they were seated at the kitchen table with steaming mugs of questionably packaged hot chocolate, each laced with a generous splash of Baileys—and, in Hattie’s case, a second hit of whiskey.

Muriel took a huge slurp and winced. “Okay, this drink is burning a hole in my stomach, but you’re okay, right?”

Hattie nodded, feeling the warmth of the liquor spread like a ripple into space. Probably not great to imbibe on an empty stomach.

Muriel leaned in. “So what the hell happened? Who got shot? And how did they get your gun?”

“Before I go on,” Hattie said, raising a hand, “we need to establish some ground rules about the information I’m about to disclose.”

Muriel waved her off. “Yeah, yeah, of course. Hattie Moon, get on with it already.”

Hattie took a breath. “Someone stole the gun from my purse. When? Who? Why? No clue. And I assume that same someone—whoever they are—used it to shoot at… are you ready?… Father John.”

Muriel blinked. Then blinked again. “Wait. The priest? Father John?”

“The very one.”

“But he’s, like, the most boring man in town. I heard he collects atlases and gives lectures on grain storage in the 1800s.”

“I know. Go figure.”

Muriel dropped her voice to a whisper, even though no one else was around. “Is he okay?”

“Far as I know. The bullets missed him by a mile.”

“Bullets? Plural?”

“Two.”

Muriel made that twisty thing with her mouth. “So, how did they know it was your gun?”

Hattie explained what Ted Blansky told her, then lowered her voice. “Listen, Muriel, this doesn’t go further than you and me. Don’t tell Lewis or Cartney. I don’t want Lewis thinking I’m nutso or Cartney saying, ‘I told you so.’”

Muriel nodded solemnly. “Of course. So… how’d this all get settled?”

“They brought in a character witness.”

“Who? No one called me.”

“Horatio. The gentleman who gave me the gun.”

Muriel sat back. “Whoa. Did he get arrested?”

Hattie shook her head. “No. Neither of us did. I think they just chalked us up as dithering old people.”

“Probably the only perk of being ancient,” Muriel muttered, then, “How old is this guy?”

Hattie shrugged. “Little younger than me, I think. But what is age but a number?”

Muriel raised a brow. “Is he handsome?”

“Handsome like Gregory Peck or like Paul Newman?”

“Either. Both.”

Hattie grinned. “Muriel, just say what you want to say.”

“What would that be, Smarty Pants?”

“You want to know if I like him and if he likes me.”

“Well… yes. So? Do you?”

“Oh, Muriel, we just met.”

“But are you flirting?”

“I wouldn’t know how.”

Muriel sighed. “Still. Nice to have a new friend.”

Hattie hesitated. Then decided to let the cat out of the bag. “We’re going to dinner tomorrow night.”

“What?! Gurl is in the house! This is so exciting! …Wait. Where are you going?”

“I don’t know. He’s making the arrangements.”

Muriel’s expression shifted. “Okay, hang on. Are you meeting him there? Who’s driving?”

“He’s picking me up.”

Muriel’s smile vanished. “Hattie. You just met this man. You can’t do that. It’s not safe.”

“He’s harmless.”

“He sells guns! That qualifies as an arms dealer. No, no, no—you need someone to go with you. Maybe Ralph could drive you and hang around ‘til you’re done. Like a chaperone.”

“A chaperone?”

“Yes! What can it hurt?”

“Muriel, I’ll be fine.”

Hattie reached for her mug, but her mind shifted. “Let’s talk about what really matters. Who stole my gun? Was I set up? Did Cartney do this? Maybe she wanted to teach me a lesson.”

“That sounds unlikely, Hattie.”

“Okay. But did you tell her I kept the gun in my purse?”

Muriel reared back. “I would never, ever do such a thing.”

Hattie stared at the table. “Then who knew?”


Chapter 47: Dinner

What to wear to dinner?

Casual? Dressy? Geez, what was she thinking?

The closet didn’t offer much reassurance. She pulled out the navy dress with the loose hem—too “churchy.” The mustard cardigan and brown skirt combo? Butterscotch pudding, anyone? The paisley blouse that always slid to one side? Definitely no. She tried on a black turtleneck and jeans, squinting into the mirror. The jeans still fit, but lordy, her beatnik days were over. Way over.

The pile on her bed grew.

Finally, she tried a soft plum blouse—slightly shimmery, like it was trying to be festive but not desperate about it—and a pair of black slacks that didn’t pinch. She added earrings—studs, not dangly—then debated a necklace and decided against it. Put the brakes on. Enough. Besides, there was one other matter to assemble.

She opened the top dresser drawer—the makeup junk drawer—gathered what she needed, and headed to the bathroom.

Soon, potions, lotions, powders, shadows, pencils, and lipsticks lined the sink. She took a deep breath, leaned toward the mirror, and zoomed in.

What the heck!?

And she suddenly remembered why she hadn’t bothered with any of this stuff—she was beyond help. Her lines had lines—tributaries going every which way. And where had her lips gone? Was there even enough to fill in?

Then she remembered what Carol, the YouTuber, said: “You got to accentuate the positive.”

She stepped closer to the mirror, played with some bangs, puffed blush onto her cheeks, and, with the pad of her little finger, ran lipstick along her lips. Then stood back.

Then, farther back.

Then turned off the light.

Okay. Maybe if the restaurant was dark.

Enough already.

She went to collect her coat and purse.

In the vestibule, Hattie felt the flutter of nerves in her stomach morphing into something close to claustrophobia. Her heart was tapping out a strange little rhythm when a quiet thought formed—call it off. Just call it off. Say you’re tired. Say you forgot. Say the cat threw up.

The doorbell rang.

She froze. No going back now…

He looked freshly shaved, his shirt tucked in, his collar a little too stiff. His mouth opened, then closed, and then opened again.

“I was just about to call and cancel,” Hattie blurted.

His eyebrows went up, then softened. “Yeah,” he said, nodding slowly. “I get it.”

“I feel stupid,” she admitted.

“Stupid’s not the feeling,” he said. “Maybe it’s guilt. I feel it, too.”

That took her off guard.

He rubbed the back of his neck. “I talked to Elaine this morning. Told her I was thinking about backing out. She said I should go. Said life doesn’t wait for you to stop grieving. It just… keeps walking. Told me to stop hiding behind estate sales and old records.”

Hattie breathed. Something inside her let go.

“Yes,” she said quietly. “Of course. I think Orin would want the same for me.”

They stood there momentarily, the air charged with honesty and unspoken memory.

Horatio held out a slinky. “A toy with no plan—felt relatable.”

Hattie smiled, took it, curled it open, and placed it gently on the table. “Poor thing,” she said. “Let’s give it a rest.”

“Yes, these babies are always ready to take off down the stairs.”

Hattie smiled. “What shall we call him? Or is it a her?”

Horatio studied the toy, then grinned. “She told me her name’s Doris... Ready to go?” he asked, offering his arm.

She slipped her hand into the crook of his elbow.

* * *

Inside, they were seated near the window. Bread arrived in a basket, and olive oil was in a little dish with swirls of balsamic. Hattie tore off a piece of bread to occupy her fingers.

“So…” Horatio began, “do you always order the same thing at restaurants or branch out?”

“Branch out,” she said, “but only within a five-dish radius.”

He chuckled. “That’s… more adventurous than me.”

At first, they talked about safe things: books, the weather, and the recent town meeting where his neighbor tried to get the community garden shut down over an alleged squirrel infestation.

“I think he’s mad he can’t grow tomatoes,” Horatio said, sipping his water.

Hattie leaned in slightly. “Have you ever had to trap a squirrel?”

“You offering?”

She laughed and felt a blush rise. “I like talking to you.”

“Me too.”

They were halfway through their pasta when Horatio set down his fork, wiped his mouth, and leaned in.

“I spoke to the detective today.”

Hattie paused, her spaghetti twirled onto her fork. “You did? What did he say?”

“They’re not pressing charges. Not against you. Not against me either, as long as the gun stays out of circulation.”

Hattie blinked. “That’s it?”

“That’s it. The firearm's being destroyed. Case closed. No court, no fine, no criminal record.”

She set down her fork and took a deep breath. Relief swept through her. “Thanks. I’ll sleep better tonight.”

Horatio leaned in. “I’ve been thinking. About you, walking around without that derringer. How about taking a self-defense class?”

She looked up, eyebrows raised. “You’re suggesting I learn to fight?”

“Not fight. Defend. There’s a difference.” He softened his tone. “Just enough to feel confident. There are classes around town. Some are even designed for women our age. Slow-paced, smart, no rolling around on the floor.”

“Because I’d need a crane to get up.”

He chuckled. “Exactly. They teach you to use what you already have—your voice, your posture. It’s not about being stronger than someone; it’s about catching them off guard and getting away.”

Hattie smiled. “I like the idea of yelling. I’ve still got good lungs.”

“You’ve got a good everything.” Horatio gave her a wink. “But it wouldn’t hurt to add a few moves to your arsenal… Dessert and coffee?”

Hattie looked into his kind face. “Yes, that would be lovely.” She blushed. “You’re good at this.”

“At what?”

“Making me feel like I’m ten feet tall.”

“Ditto.”

“You know,” she said softly, “the funny thing is… the older I get, the less afraid I am. Isn’t that odd?”

Horatio looked at her for a long moment, then nodded. “No. It’s not odd at all. When we’re young, we’ve got so much to lose—our futures, our pride, our place in the world. Everything feels like it could fall apart if we make the wrong move. But the older we get, we’ve lived through the worst nights, said goodbye to people we thought we couldn’t live without, and survived heartaches we never thought we’d mend. And here we are. Battered and bruised but still breathing.”

Hattie’s eyes softened. “So it’s time to ride it out?”

“Yes, just float downstream.”

They sat quietly until Hattie leaned back and smiled. “Then maybe peace isn’t something we chase. Maybe it’s what finally catches up to us when we stop running.”

Horatio reached out and squeezed her arm. “Same idea.” He paused. “We spend so long bracing for the storm, we forget we’re allowed to rest when the sun comes out.”


Chapter 48: Stunned But Still Standing

Stunned, Hattie stood in the middle of her living room, coat over her arm, purse dangling loosely from her hand. She turned in a slow circle, taking in the familiar space—the same dusty snake plant, cat-furred rug, and faded floral couch—yet it all looked… brighter. As if someone had come in and quietly sprinkled magic into the air.

She let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding, set her things on the side chair, and eased onto the couch. The cushions welcomed her like old friends. She just sat there for a moment, smiling to herself like a teenager who had been kissed for the first time. Not that anything like that had happened. It wasn’t that kind of night.

Still, something had shifted.

“Lucy,” she called softly.

The cat padded in from the hallway with her usual unhurried air, hopped onto the couch, and settled herself against Hattie’s thigh, purring before she’d even been touched. Hattie ran her hand along Lucy’s back, feeling the delicate rise and fall of breath beneath her fur, the warmth that pulsed in small, living waves.

She closed her eyes and let the sound move through her like a balm. It was a minor, ordinary miracle, the way a cat could root you to the moment, slow the spinning world, and mute the din of worry. There was no mansion, no mystery, no loose ends clamoring for resolution—just this.

The hush was so complete she almost didn’t hear it at first—a knock—not on the door, but the window.

She opened her eyes, heart skipping.

Another knock.

Then a voice.

“Hattie? It’s me. Muriel…”

* * *

“I was in bed,” Muriel said, brushing past her into the living room, “but I couldn’t sleep, so I thought Hattie had a date, and then I thought, What if she’s in love? And I had to come over.”She held up a Tupperware container. “I brought pie. Leftover. Rhubarb. Mostly crust, the best part.” Muriel put down the pie and flopped onto the couch. “So?” Muriel asked, eyes bright. “Did he kiss you?”

Hattie rolled her eyes. “Now, I’m not the kind of girl to kiss and tell.”

“Right. Did he try to kiss you?”

“No!”

“Did you want him to try to kiss you?”

“Muriel!”

“I’m just saying, your hair looks suspiciously brushed, and there’s a glow about you that says either I met a wonderful man or I have a shrimp  allergy.”

Hattie sat down and took a deep breath. “It was… lovely. Better than I expected.”

Muriel leaned back with a satisfied sigh. “You’ve crossed the threshold.”

“What threshold?”

“The one where you realize you’re not dead yet.”

Hattie blinked. “Well, thank you for that.”

“I mean it in the best way. Look at you. Lipstick. Earrings. In the blush of young love, I’d say. Or is it indigestion?”

Hattie couldn’t help but laugh. “You’re a menace.”

“I’m your menace,” Muriel said, reaching over and patting her hand. “Now tell me everything. Leave nothing out. Especially anything involving desserts or shoulder touches.

Eventually, the pie was gone, the retelling complete, and Muriel was headed to the door. Before leaving, her friend stopped and turned. “I have the new keys to the mansion. We’re heading back tomorrow. Is that okay?”

“Yes.”

“Great! We’ll be by around 10.” Muriel reached for Hattie and gave her a bear hug. “For two old hags, we’ve won the lottery.”

Hattie nodded. “I guess so.”

After waving bye, Hattie looked toward Orin’s photo. “I had a nice time tonight,” she whispered. “Hope that’s okay.”

The house said nothing, but something in her chest felt lighter. Winning the lottery was more fun than she could have ever imagined.


Chapter 49: Dank Revisited

With Cartney off gathering items from Flynn’s mother’s bedroom for DNA testing, Muriel stood in the middle of Flynn’s lair. “This place is creepy,” she said. “Not just how Flynn lived—but everything feels… disjointed. Sad. Can you imagine sleeping here?”

Hattie understood and agreed. The room didn’t have a window and was dim, dank, and dark. The chaotic mess in the main house was bad, but this space was more disconcerting—there was no evidence of a home. It felt wrong—wrong in its silence, wrong in its stillness.

“I can’t imagine living here, never mind sleeping,” Hattie said.

Muriel wandered to the far wall, scanning up and down as if looking for something. “There’s a crack here,” she said. “Like the paneling doesn’t quite match.”

Hattie stepped closer. Her eyes followed the outline Muriel had spotted. A faint seam ran from bottom to top and across, marking the outline of a square.

“Looks like a secret door.” Hattie glanced around for a pull or knob. “But I can’t see how it opens.”

“Let’s try this,” Muriel said, pushing against the edges.

With a soft click, the panel popped open about an inch. Muriel turned to Hattie. “Jeez. Are we ready to find out what’s behind door number one? Dollars to donuts it’s not a Mustang. It’s probably a ghost. Or a pile of toenail clippings. We gotta go in. You ready?”

Hattie was more curious than afraid. “Do you want me to look first?”

“Okay.”

Muriel stepped aside and opened the door wider. Hattie poked her head in. “Wow.”

Muriel scooted around her. “Yikes. It’s the real deal. A treasure chest! And it’s open!”

Inside was a hulking, old-fashioned safe made of thick steel. It had a tarnished brass dial and a long, horizontal handle. The metal was scratched and dull, pitted with age.

And it was ajar.

Hattie leaned in. The door was cracked just enough to suggest someone had opened it—maybe recently—and either forgot or didn’t bother to shut it again. Her breath caught as she reached out and pulled it open the rest of the way. The hinges groaned in protest. A stale breath of air emerged, smelling of paper.

“OMG,” Muriel said. “We found it! He kept it all here. What should we do?”

“I think you should call Lewis. He needs to know and get this stuff out of here.”

Muriel nodded. “For sure.” She looked around. “My phone’s in the library. Be back.”

As Muriel left to call Lewis, Hattie leaned in closer. From what she could see, there were stacks of papers tied with brittle twine, envelopes yellowed at the edges, bundles of cash with bank bands, documents with heavily embossed seals, stock certificates, bonds, and a thick ledger with a worn, split spine.

On a narrow top shelf, five newspapers were stacked in a yellowed bundle, fewer than the trove they’d found in the library. Brittle bits flaked off as she carefully pulled them out and set them on the floor. The top nameplate read Courier.

Just then, Cartney appeared in the doorway, carrying an old wooden jewelry box.

“Found this upstairs and put stuff inside,” she said, setting the box down. “There’s a hairbrush with a few strands in it. One of those perfume bottles and a scarf that still had some scent on it. This added to Flynn’s pillow should be enough for DNA testing.” She looked over and saw the open safe. “Whoa. What did I miss?”

“Flynn’s stash,” Hattie said. “The real deal. You want to check it out?”

Cartney stepped forward and peered into the vault. “Well, well. Would you look at that? Lewis may have hit the jackpot.”

Muriel returned. “He’s on his way. Should be here in a few.” She glanced at Cartney’s haul. “Nice work.”

“Thanks,” Cartney said, looking at the safe. “Nothing like burying treasure in your closet.”

Hattie nodded. “There are more newspapers inside. While we wait for Lewis, why not look through one? Maybe Flynn used them to wrap stuff in.”

“Wouldn’t surprise me,” Muriel said. “Let’s do it.”

Hattie made room on the floor and unfolded the top newspaper. As she turned each page, nothing remarkable appeared—except the past.

“I forgot about these old department stores,” Muriel said, tapping an ad.

“Look at this one,” Hattie said, pointing to a page filled with shag carpet and walnut stereo consoles. “That’s the exact setup my sister had.”

They laughed at what people wore, what they bought, and what they thought was important enough to print.

Cartney leaned against the wall, arms crossed. “It’s strange. How we keep things and hang on to them for reasons long forgotten.”

Hattie nodded. “Say, why don’t we keep these and look them over at my place when we’re feeling nostalgic?”

“I’d love that,” Muriel said.

As Hattie put them aside, a door opened, and two men’s voices filtered into the room from outside. Moments later, Lewis and Mike stepped into Flynn’s lair.


Chapter 50: Lewis and Mike

Lewis saw the open safe and made a beeline for it. “Oh my God!” he blurted out. “This is it, exactly what I hoped for!”

Mike stayed close, eyes scanning the room.

Lewis knelt and began pulling things out. “These are gold,” he said, more to himself than anyone else. “This… this could change everything. Property deeds, original stock shares, bank drafts. Some of these go back decades. If they’re valid, I can finally settle the estate. Officially. Whoa! And there’s the cash.”

He glanced back at them, eyes lit with hope. “These documents could clarify asses, debts, and house ownership.”

He reached in again and pulled out a thick ledger. The spine was frayed, the leather warped with age. He flipped it open and ran his fingers across the inked columns. “And here—dates, distributions, land transfers... even names. This isn’t just about Flynn. This goes back generations.”

Mike gave a whistle. “Well, damn.”

Hattie stood quietly. All the silence and stillness of the room suddenly made sense. Flynn hadn’t lived here. He’d preserved it. Guarded it.

Muriel beamed. “Snooks, it’s all coming together.”

Lewis nodded, still flipping pages. “You don’t know how many loose ends this will tie up. I’ve been chasing shadows—insurance, inheritance, back taxes. This is tangible. It’s all here. Until now, there was no record—just assumptions and guesswork. But this? This locks down the inheritance. It validates Flynn’s ownership of the house, the land, and the assets. It gives me something concrete to work with. I can settle the estate cleanly.” He let out a long breath.

Mike clapped him on the shoulder. “Good for you.”

Lewis looked as if he had just finished a marathon. “It’s a huge relief.”

Hattie watched the tension ease from his shoulders.

“Just so you know,” Cartney said, “I gathered some items from Flynn’s mother’s bedroom that may have viable DNA from his mother. This, with Flynn’s pillowcase, should give us a lot of information about whoever claims to be related to either of them.”

Lewis nodded, pleased. “Great. That’ll hopefully give the court something to stand on. Ms. Postman is persistent and litigious, and I’m certain she’ll fight it if she thinks she has the smallest chance.”

He gathered the safe’s contents and DNA samples into separate boxes. “I’ll get these secured and start the filings. This—” he looked around, eyes a little dazed, “this is the turning point I didn’t think I’d get.”

He shook each of their hands, then made his way out.

With the room quiet, the remaining group moved into task mode—boxed what needed saving and bagged what didn’t. Jack was the first to finish. He hoisted the last bag into his arms and gave a short wave. “Truck’s loaded. Let me know if you need more stuff taken out.”

After Mike left, they busied themselves with cleaning up, when Hattie paused, glancing at the floor. “The newspapers. They’re gone.”

Muriel paused. “You sure?”

“I had a little stack here that I wanted to take home.”

Cartney shrugged. “Mike probably tossed them.”

“Yes, that makes sense. They weren’t labeled or anything.”

Cartney glanced at her watch. “You two hungry? I could use something that’s not wrapped in plastic or covered in dust.”

Hattie smiled. “Let’s do it.”

And with that, they walked into the afternoon sun with a lighter step and a job well done.


Chapter 51: Beans Spilled

“Nothing like a chocolate shake,” Hattie said, sipping the thick, cold confection and letting it melt in her mouth.

“Agreed,” Muriel said. “I haven’t had one in months. Definitely evil—in the best way.”

Cartney twirled a French fry through a puddle of ketchup. “What a great day. We finally made some progress. I was starting to feel bad for Lewis.”

“Oh, he’s fine,” Muriel said. “And after today, it should be smooth sailing.”

Cartney popped the fry into her mouth and chased it with a swig of Coke. “Did he mention anything about those medicines? You know how to handle that stuff.”

“He contacted the state. They’re supposed to give him the name of a certified hazardous waste guy. But so far, it’s just voicemails and promises to call back.”

Cartney nodded. “Makes sense… So what have you ladies been up to?”

“Hattie met a—” Muriel stopped midstream and clamped a hand over her mouth.

Cartney, mid-bite, looked over at Hattie. “Who’d you meet?”

Lordy. This could go south fast.

Hattie scrambled to change the subject. “A man. You know, a guy-type person.”

“Yeah, most men are guys,” Cartney said, grinning. “How’d you meet him?”

“Online?”

Cartney squinted. “Is that a question or an answer?”

Neither Hattie nor Muriel responded.

Cartney leaned back in her chair, a sly grin spreading across her face. “Ladies, what are you hiding? May as well tell me now because I will find out.” She turned to Hattie. “So, who is this guy?”

Hattie stayed quiet, trying to summon a new excuse.

Muriel blurted, “He sold her the gun.”

Cartney blinked, eyes narrowing at Hattie. “You’re seeing someone who sells guns?”

“I don’t think he sells guns per se. He buys and sells stuff from estate sales.”

“I see,” Cartney said. “So, Muriel, have you met him?”

“Um, no… well, not yet. He sounds very nice. Hattie likes him a lot.”

“Muriel, I’m curious—what makes him so nice?”

“For one thing, when Hattie was arrested, he came—” Suddenly, Muriel realized she had made another faux pas.

The background noise of McDonald’s seemed to fade away. Hattie felt the heat rise in her cheeks—time to dive in.“Muriel, come to think of it, he was rather gallant.”

“Gallant?” Cartney said, “That’s great, but… can I ask, why were you arrested?”

“I wasn’t arrested,” Hattie said quickly. “I was brought in for questioning. Apparently, a man was shot at with my stolen gun. But the charges were dropped. So… no biggie.”

“Okay, ladies,” Cartney said, raising her hands. I’d love to end this conversation, but since the beans are spilled, I have questions. Number one: Who was shot at?”

Hattie took a deep breath. “Father John.”

Cartney stopped chewing. “The priest?”

“He’s okay.”

“When did this happen?”

“A few days ago.”

Cartney’s hands went up again. “Right. Now tell me where your gun was.”

“In my purse.”

“Okay.” Cartney paused, keeping her tone even. “So it was stolen from your purse?”

Hattie nodded.

Cartney tilted her head, thinking aloud. “Let me work this out. You had a gun in your purse. It was stolen. Someone used it to shoot at Father John… This wasn’t random. I’m guessing it was stolen at the mansion.”

Muriel reared back. “How can you be so sure?”

“Simple. There’s one gun, one place, one victim. That’s where everything intersects.” Cartney turned to Hattie. “So, who was around when you had your purse at the house?”

Muriel raised her hand. “That leaves Mike—or maybe that Winston guy.”

Cartney nodded slowly. “Yes… but I think there’s someone else.”

Hattie furrowed her brow. “Wait. Remember when Father John stopped by to return that book? He asked me to join him in the library.”

Muriel nodded.

“He said he saw a mouse and asked for a broom. I left him alone and went into the kitchen. But—I never saw a mouse. That was just his word.”

Muriel tapped her fingers on the table. “But he was the one who got shot at. Not the shooter.”

“Or maybe both,” Cartney said. “What if he took the gun, fired it at his own house, then planted it somewhere obvious and played dumb when it was found?”

Muriel frowned. “But why would he do that?”

Hattie’s gut twisted. For the first time that day, something clicked.

“I asked him about the ledger,” she said. “Whether Flynn paid him in cash or by check. Maybe he thinks I’m onto him—and wants me out of the way.”

“Hmm,” Cartney said. “But how would he know about your gun? Did you ever talk about it while at the mansion?”

Both women thought.

“Wait,” Muriel said. “We were all in the library talking about the gun. That’s when you got upset and left the room. When you were gone, I asked Hattie where the gun was; she pointed to her purse. I said something like, ‘Your purse. Close call.’ But it was just the two of us in the room.”

“So how did he know?” Hattie asked, chills running up her spine.

Cartney went quiet, then narrowed her eyes.

“I have an idea. Maybe a couple. We need to go back tomorrow—and check for bugs. And we should find that darn ledger.”


Chapter 52: A Bug

Hattie, Muriel, and Cartney returned to the library the following day. The room was still and dim, as it always was in the morning, but something in the air felt off. Hattie couldn’t explain it—just a quiet pressure, like a secret waiting to be uncovered.

Cartney stepped in behind them, her gaze sweeping the walls, the shelves, the corners. “All right,” she said softly, “here’s what we’re going to do.”

Hattie and Muriel both turned to her.

“If there’s a bug in here, it’s probably sound-activated,” Cartney continued. “Or at least designed to pick up the conversation. They’re tiny these days. Hard to see. But sometimes they give themselves away if you know how to listen.”

Muriel looked skeptical. “You mean you can hear them?”

“Sometimes. They make the faintest sound—usually not noticeable until you force them to react. The trick is to be completely still. Quiet. Then make one sharp noise. If there’s a device nearby, it might click or buzz right after, adjusting to catch the sound.”

Hattie raised an eyebrow. “So we flush it out?”

“Exactly,” Cartney said. “But we need to be in position first. I want you to stand in a different part of the room as far from each other as you can. Close to things—shelves, outlets, furniture. Listen with your full attention. I’ll be in the center. When I make the noise, don’t say a word—listen.”

“Wait a minute,” said Muriel. “Could they be listening to us right now?”

Cartney shrugged. “Well, if they are, they’re probably pooping their pants. Let’s give them a show.”

Hattie moved to the far wall by the old cabinet, and Muriel took the reading nook under the window. Cartney stayed near the center rug, glancing at each of them to make sure they were ready.

Then, without warning, she clapped her hands—once, sharp and loud. The sound echoed off the walls.

Silence followed.

Hattie held her breath, ears straining. For a moment, nothing. Then—there. The faintest of a click. She leaned closer, her heart beating a little faster.

After several seconds, Cartney spoke. “Did either of you hear anything?”

Hattie straightened. “A click. Back here. Very faint, just after the clap.”

Cartney headed across the rug. “That’s good.” She pulled a small flashlight from her coat pocket and moved toward Hattie, who stepped aside. Cartney ran a hand along the back edge of the cabinet and stopped.

“Here,” she said quietly. “I feel something.” Moments later, she extracted a small, black square shorter than a paperclip.

“That’s not from the seventies,” Hattie whispered.

Cartney held it between her fingers. “Nope. This is recent. Mid-range. Bluetooth enabled. Not top-tier, but solid enough. Someone knew what they were doing.”

Muriel had drifted over, arms folded. “So now what? Do we leave it in? Say something scandalous?”

Cartney smirked. “Tempting. But no—we’ve confirmed it’s here. Time to take it offline.”

She pulled a little plastic evidence bag from her coat.

Hattie blinked. “You carry those around?”

“You don’t?”

Hattie laughed, her pulse still thudding against her ribs. “So that’s it? That was the only one?”

“We could sweep again,” Cartney said, “but I doubt we’ll find more—not in this room. And if this one’s bugged, others might be too. The thing is, the bugger’s probably the same person. From what you’ve told me—that means Father John. You guys talked about the gun, and he knew where to look. Of course, why and when he stole the gun remains a mystery… Hattie, about that ledger tracking all the money given to Father John. Where is it?”

Hattie looked around the room. “It should be in the rolltop. I put it there myself.”

The desk loomed in the corner, solid and familiar. Hattie unlatched the top and pushed the curved wood upward until it disappeared. The desktop was clean. She opened the center drawer, the side cubbies, and the hidden slot beneath the blotter—no ledger.

She checked again, slower this time, pulling out each compartment and checking along the bottoms and backs. “Can’t find it.”

“You’re telling me it’s gone?” Muriel said.

“It was right here.”

“Doesn’t look good for Father John,” Cartney said quietly.

Hattie felt a knot in her stomach. It wasn’t fear. Not even shock. Just a deep, cold unease. “He always seemed so harmless.”

“Yeah,” Cartney said. “So do housecats—until you try to take their kill.”

Muriel leaned over the desk. “I guess it’s not over until it’s over.”

Hattie couldn’t disagree. On the way to the car, she wondered what Father John was desperate to hide.


Chapter 53: A Surprise Visit

As soon as Hattie got home, she took a quick shower. She had to wash off the energy she felt from the mansion. As the water ran over her, she imagined all the troubling and sinister feelings sliding down the drain.

She used her peppermint shampoo, even though it stung her eyes and made her scalp feel like it was vibrating. She scrubbed hard with the loofah, then stood under the spray until it turned cold. Only then did she feel like herself again—or some version of herself. Not quite the old Hattie, but not the version who had been wandering the mansion.

She wrapped herself in her thickest robe, the green one with the fraying cuff, and padded into the kitchen, where Lucy was perched on the counter, tail curled neatly around her feet like a question mark.

“There you are,” Hattie muttered, stroking the cat’s silky back. “You missed all the drama.”

Lucy blinked, then jumped down to rub against Hattie’s legs.

Before long, with a pot of tea, she went into the living room and settled onto the couch when there was a knock at the door… then another.

Lucy darted to the window, her ears twitching. Hattie stood, crept over and peeked through the curtain. Her breath caught.

Mike Grady?

How did he know where she lived? Why was he here? And why now, when she was alone?

She didn’t open the door right away. Instead, she cracked it open, keeping the chain latched.

“Hello Mike, what a nice surprise. I’m in the middle of something. Can you wait a few minutes?”

Mike stepped back slightly. “Sure thing. I just want to talk, Hattie. That’s all.”

“Talk?” Her eyes narrowed. She let the word hang there, testing it. “I’ll be with you.”

Before he responded, she shut the door and made a beeline for the phone.

“Muriel,” Hattie muttered, punching the number with a trembling finger. “Please be there. Please. Please.”

The phone rang once, twice—

“Hello?”

“Muriel,” Hattie whispered. “Come here. Now.”

“What? Why? What happened?”

“Please. Just come over. As soon as you can.”

“…Okay. I’m on my way.”

Click.

Hattie took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and walked slowly back to the door. She slid off the chain.

The man did not look well.

Mike Grady stood on her porch like someone who’d wandered out of a storm, though the sky was clear. He looked older and more worn down. His hair was damp with sweat, clinging to his forehead, and deep lines had etched themselves into the corners of his eyes. The heavy backpack on his shoulders seemed to weigh him down as if gravity had become personal.

“Hattie,” he said, voice low and rough. “I… I have to talk to you. I can’t keep it in any longer.”

Confession? Was this some kind of confession? Thank God Muriel was heading over.

“What happened?” she asked, keeping her tone even.

He shook his head. “I don’t know where to start. I need your advice.”

Advice. That could mean anything. Still, she noted the look in his eyes—not the twitchy evasiveness of a liar, but the raw, unsettled confusion of someone barely holding on.

She gestured inside. “Come in, then. Before Lucy starts interrogating you.”

As if on cue, the cat slinked past Mike’s leg, tail high, giving him a wide berth.

“Oh, Hattie,” he said, rubbing a hand across his face. “I finally got what I was looking for. And now… everything’s coming back. I’m starting to lose it.”

Hattie stiffened. “What’s coming back?”

He looked up at her, his eyes rimmed with red. “My daughter. It’s like I’m reliving it all over again.”

Hattie didn’t speak. Not yet. She studied him carefully—his posture, the shaking of his hands, the way his jaw clenched between words. Was this real? A ploy? Was he truly unraveling?

Something about him—the backpack, the shadows under his eyes, the helplessness in his voice—made her lean slightly toward believing him.

“Maybe you can help,” he added, his voice nearly breaking.

She took a breath, steady but quiet, and nodded once. “Come sit. Let’s see if we can make sense of it together.”

Mike moved to the armchair. Hattie remained standing, watching him. Was he friend or foe? But one thing was clear—whatever he was about to say would change something.

And Muriel couldn’t get there fast enough.

He pulled off his backpack, dug inside, and lifted out a book. He placed it on his lap and took a deep breath. Hattie glanced down.

The Catcher in the Rye. A paperback, quite worn.

She waited, but when he didn’t speak, she asked, “Is that the same copy we found at the mansion?”

He nodded. “It’s my… It belonged to my daughter,” he said flatly.

Hattie leaned over and patted his leg. “Take your time,” she said gently.

“Umm… this is really hard.”

“Yes. I see… Would you like a drink? Water, coffee, or something stronger?”

“No, thank you.” He wiped his nose and took a breath—”

Suddenly,  the kitchen door opened and slammed shut.

“Is someone here? I should go…” He was about to stand when Hattie whispered, “It’s only Muriel. There’s no need to leave.”

“Muriel?” he echoed.

“Yes. We’re neighbors. Is that okay?”

He nodded and wiped his eyes. “Yes. I suppose so.”

They both turned. The shock on Muriel’s face was barely noticeable. Her brows lifted for a moment, but that was it. Thank God.

“Mike! How nice to see you. Hattie didn’t mention you were coming over. Are you joining us for dinner?”

He shook his head and seemed at a loss. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know you were about to have company… I should probably leave.”

Muriel blinked at Hattie, who gave her a slight, meaningful nod.

“Oh, no, we wouldn’t think of you leaving. It’s wine time. Can I interest you in a drink?”

“No, thank you. Hattie already offered.”

Muriel walked over to her regular spot but let her eyes linger on Mike just a moment longer than usual. “Well then, I’ll probably have a Baileys but will wait.”

“Muriel, Mike was just telling me about a book he brought over. The Catcher in the Rye. Remember?”

“Yes, of course. It was from the school library that closed.”

No one continued the conversation.

“So, Mike, did you want to discuss the book?” Hattie asked.

“It belonged to my daughter,” he said again, more quietly.

Hattie thought for a moment, then said, “Isn’t this a small world? You found one of her books in Flynn’s library. They must’ve had a book sale when they closed up.”

He shook his head. “Don’t think so.”

Hattie and Muriel exchanged a glance.

Mike went quiet. Then, slowly, he reached into his pocket and laid down a plastic bag with two small items: a mood ring and a strawberry lip gloss. “I also found these in the junk drawer in the kitchen,” he said quietly. “She had them on her when she disappeared.”

Hattie’s heart skipped a beat. She opened her mouth, but nothing came out.


Chapter 54: Tip of the Iceberg

Hattie glanced at Muriel. Her friend’s face had turned pale, frozen.

“I’m sorry. I don’t want to upset either of you.” He shifted slightly as if he might stand. “I should leave.”

“No,” Muriel said quickly. “We’re here for you. Maybe we can help.”

A slight smile came to his lips. “I was hoping so… This is the thing, I just—” His voice trailed off into nothingness.

Hattie stepped in. “Yes. It’s hard. There’s no hurry… Maybe you could start by telling us about your daughter.”

He stared at the floor. “She was a beautiful girl. Her name was Rachel.” He looked up, his eyes meeting Hattie’s. “She loved school. Hell, she loved everybody.” He took a deep, choppy breath.

“You’re doing great,” Muriel said gently.

“One day, she went to school and never came back.” He exhaled, long and slow. “That was thirty years ago.”

“How awful,” Hattie said softly.

“I worked with the police, but since there was never a body, it became a cold case—no evidence, no leads... just gone. But I knew—” He paused, voice tightening. “I knew she didn’t run away. I knew something had happened. She was murdered. I’ve believed that from the beginning.”

Silence settled over the room.

Muriel leaned forward slightly, her eyes on the mood ring. “Are you saying… these were your daughter’s?”

Mike nodded. His voice came out low and raspy. “Rachel. She was fifteen. Disappeared on her way home from school. I did everything I could to find her. I knocked on doors, put up flyers, and begged for tips. The police helped—at first—but eventually, they started saying she must’ve taken off. Or gotten involved with the wrong people. But that wasn’t Rachel.”

He looked at Hattie again, eyes heavy. “She was the kind of kid who’d cry if someone else got picked on. She was kind. Smart. Always trying to keep the peace between her mother and me. She never would’ve run. Never.”

Muriel’s voice was a whisper. “So... you believe Flynn killed her?”

“I don’t just believe it,” Mike said, tightening his jaw. “I’m certain. I just could never prove it.”

Hattie sat back slightly. “What made you suspect him?”

“It took years,” he said. “Years of digging through dead ends. I followed every rumor, every lead. Drove through every damn town from here to Albany. But eventually... I started looking at geography. Flynn’s house was right between her school and her mother’s apartment. Like—almost exactly halfway. And that stuck with me.”

“You knew Flynn?” Hattie asked.

“Not really. Saw him around. He lived alone, kept to himself. Didn’t talk to the neighbors. People said he had no family… And something about that felt off.”

Hattie exchanged a glance with Muriel. “But how did you go from that to suspecting he was involved in Rachel’s death?”

Mike ran a hand through his hair and glanced at the ring and lip balm as if hoping for an answer.

“You want to know what first made me wonder? Halloween.”

“Halloween?” Muriel echoed.

“Yeah.” He gave a dry laugh. “For a guy who kept to himself all year, he’d go all out—giant spiderwebs, a graveyard in the yard, sound effects. Every year. Kids loved it. But I couldn’t stop thinking: what kind of loner opens his house to the neighborhood one night a year? It felt like a performance. A distraction.”

“Did Rachel ever mention him?” Hattie asked.

Mike shook his head. “Never. But she would’ve smiled at him and talked to him. She was trusting like that. Too trusting.”

He paused, voice raw. “Maybe she thought he was harmless. Maybe she went inside because she thought he needed a friend. Or maybe she thought she could help. Maybe... maybe she thought he was safe.”

His voice cracked. “That makes sense, right?”

Then the dam broke. Mike folded forward, elbows on knees, face in his hands. His shoulders shook with its force.

Hattie’s stomach turned. What the hell had happened to this man’s daughter?

She stood, her voice sharper than she meant it to be. “Before you go any further down that road—just know—Flynn was a troubled man. Full stop.”

Muriel’s eyes flicked toward her.

Hattie continued, more gently now. “Whatever Rachel thought, whatever she hoped for... it wasn’t her fault. And it wasn’t yours. He fooled people. All of us. Don’t go blaming her for that.”

Mike looked up slowly, his face blotchy and worn. “I don’t blame her,” he said. “I blame me. I should’ve known. I should’ve been there.”

“You couldn’t have known,” Muriel said softly. “No one did. Not until it was too late.”

“Yeah,” he murmured. “But that doesn’t help me sleep. I dropped the ball. And when the case went cold, and the leads dried up, I checked out. I started drinking. Stayed drunk for years.”

He rubbed his face. “Then... I stopped. I stopped feeling sorry for myself.”

Hattie tilted her head. “You mean you stopped drinking?”

“Yes. I got sober. It wasn’t easy, but I did it. Swallowed my pride, rolled up my sleeves, and found a way into Flynn’s world.”

Muriel blinked. “What do you mean, into his world?”

“I became useful to him. Friendly. The kind of guy he could call for help. I smiled. I played the part. All so I could get close. I needed to see what he was hiding.”

He laughed bitterly. “And guess what? I found nothing. For years—nothing. Until you ladies showed up, until everything came flooding back, and I realized it was worse than I ever imagined.”

Hattie’s stomach clenched. “Worse... how?”

He didn’t answer. He reached into his backpack and pulled out a stack of newspapers.


Chapter 55: The Iceberg

Hattie immediately recognized the newspapers—those found in Flynn’s safe. Lordy. On top of the stack were handwritten pages.

“I’ve been taking notes and stuff,” Mike said, glancing between Hattie and Muriel. “Rachel wasn’t the only one.”

Hattie’s breath caught. The only one? “I don’t understand,” she said.

Muriel leaned forward, voice tinged with disbelief. “Are you saying there were other girls? Do you mean missing? Dead?”

“Yes,” he said flatly, pointing to the papers. “And they’re all here.”

Before either woman could speak, Mike unfolded the top page, his hands trembling slightly. The room seemed to tighten around them.

“The first girl,” he began, “was Emily Santos. Thirty-five years ago. Seventeen. Lived with her grandmother about a mile from the mansion. Disappeared while walking home from a part-time job at the bakery on King Street. The paper speculated she ran off with a boyfriend. But there was never any confirmation. She was never found.”

He flipped to the next article.

“Rachel. Thirty years ago. My daughter. You know her story.”

Silence.

“Dana Reeves. Twenty-eight years ago. Sixteen. Worked summers at the town pool. Lived on Cypress, maybe three-quarters of a mile away. Had to pass the mansion to get home. Disappeared after lifeguard training. Some thought she hitched a ride and ran away. Her mom said she never would’ve left without her stuffed rabbit.”

Next.

“Colleen Baird. Twenty-five years ago. Fifteen. She had a piano lesson at a house down the block from Flynn’s. Her parents said she left the lesson but never returned home. Police figured she got lost.”

He laid the papers on the table, lining them up carefully.

“Jessie Lynn Carver. Twenty years ago. Seventeen. Volunteered at the library. Rode her bike everywhere. It was found propped neatly behind the library, but Jessie was gone. Her case got some attention, but people eventually chalked it up to a random abduction.”

Hattie watched his hands shake as he reached for the final article.

He looked up. “That’s five girls over fifteen years. All vanished without a trace. All lived, worked, or spent time within a mile of Flynn’s house.”

Hattie stared at the clippings—young faces, sad eyes, headlines clipped with time. Her mind reeled. “But… how did no one see this? Why didn’t anyone connect them?”

Mike picked up his notes—pages scrawled with names, dates, and addresses. Arrows linked maps and timelines like a web.

“They were spread out. One supposedly ran off with a boyfriend. Another was labeled a runaway. A few families moved away. The cases faded. People stopped asking questions.”

Muriel whispered, “Flynn lived there all his life. And he came from a distinguished family.”

“Exactly,” Mike said. He gestured to the table. “The girls weren’t in the same grade. Different backgrounds, different social circles, and years apart. Just enough to throw people off. But when I plotted it out on a map—everyone passed by Flynn’s house for one reason or another.”

He looked down voice barely above a whisper. “I think he watched them. Picked them off one by one.”

Hattie felt something twist in her chest. “But why keep the newspapers? Why hold on to these?”

Mike shook his head. “I don’t know. Maybe they were trophies. Maybe he liked remembering. Or maybe, deep down, he wanted someone to find them.”

Muriel’s voice shook. “Well, someone has. So now what?”

Mike rubbed his face. “I still have to find her. Rachel. Whatever there is. And now, knowing there might be others… I can’t move on. I don’t know what to do,” he muttered. “The police never believed me. Not after Rachel. I was just some angry drunk who asked too many questions.”

“They dismissed you,” Muriel said.

“Worse,” he replied. “They pitied me. Said I was obsessed. That I was making patterns out of smoke.”

Hattie folded her arms. “And now?”

He looked at the stack of articles and the tangled web of notes. “Now I’ve got this—this whole damn iceberg—and I still don’t know if they’ll take it seriously.”

“They have to,” Muriel said. “This is evidence. Cold cases. All linked.”

Hattie was quiet for a moment, then said, “There might be someone else. Someone who will listen.”

Mike blinked. “Who?”

“Lewis.”

Mike frowned. “Your boss?”

“He’s more than that,” Hattie said. “He’s smart. He’s calm. He listens. And he cares.”

Muriel nodded. “Lewis knows how to walk a fine line. If you’re worried about the police blowing you off, he’s the one to go to first. He can help you figure out how to bring it forward. Or even go with you.”

Mike hesitated. “You think he’d even want to get involved?”

“He already is,” Hattie said. “He just doesn’t know it yet.”

Mike cracked a small, tired smile for the first time. “That actually makes sense.”

Muriel reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone. “Let me call him.”


Chapter 56: The Melt

“Lewis, can you help Mike?” Muriel asked.

“Help?” He shook his head. “This is a mess.” He looked at the three of them. “That house is a crime scene—and we’ve been cleaning it out. Gosh darn it.”

“You think it’s too late?” Hattie asked.

“Well, it’s a big house. That’s both good and bad. It could take forensics a while, but we haven’t covered everything yet—not the whole house, not the grounds. If five women disappeared from there, there could still be evidence. Maybe even their remains. First thing—we need to get investigators over there. ASAP.”

Mike spoke up. “Lewis, do you think they’ll believe me?”

“I don’t see how they can ignore you.”

* * *

The waiting room chairs at the station were hard plastic and bolted to the floor like someone might run off with one. Muriel crossed her arms. Hattie sat stiffly, her purse full of mints and secrets clutched in her lap. Mike looked like he was bracing for impact. Lewis leaned against the far wall, arms folded, scanning the burglary prevention posters to distract him from what was coming.

A uniformed officer opened the inner door and called, “Lewis?”

Lewis pushed off the wall. “That’s me.” He nodded toward Mike. “He’s the one you want to hear from.”

They were led into a small conference room with a metal table and six chairs. A recording device sat in the center, its red light dark.

A detective entered. “Detective Blansky,” he said. His eyes scanned the room, landing on Hattie. “You’re back?”

Hattie gave him her sweetest smile. “Ted, this is a different matter.”

Blansky raised an eyebrow, then looked around. “All right. What’s going on?”

Mike cleared his throat, glanced at Lewis, then back at the detective. “I found something.”

His voice was tentative, shaky. Hattie watched him carefully, afraid the moment might unravel him.

Blansky gestured for everyone to sit, then opened a notepad. “Okay. And you are?”

“Michael Grady.”

Blansky scribbled, then looked up. “I think we’ve met before.”

“Yes,” Mike said. “I suspect so. I’m Rachel Carver’s father.”

Blansky gave a slight nod. “I see. What can I do for you?”

Mike reached into his bag. “I found these two items in Flynn Elwood’s kitchen. They belonged to my daughter—around the time she went missing.”

Blansky studied the contents, then looked up. “How can you be sure?”

“DNA confirmed our relation.” Mike reached into his backpack again. “It’s all in here.” He handed over a letter. As the detective read, Mike added, “I want the investigation reopened.”

Blansky remained measured. “Okay… but this alone isn’t enough to reopen a case. What else do you have?”

Hattie tensed. She worried Mike might get flustered or lash out, but his voice found strength instead.

“I have more,” Mike said, pulling out item after item. “A novel with Rachel’s name inside. The date it was loaned. Newspaper clippings. Notes.”

He laid it all out.

Blansky sat taller. He stopped writing and just listened.

When everything was on the table, Blansky sifted through the newspapers. He read a few headlines, then leaned back. “What are you saying? That Flynn Elwood murdered five girls?”

“I’m not saying anything,” Mike replied. “This speaks for itself.”

The detective turned to Hattie. “Mrs. Moon, why are you here?”

“I can vouch for Mr. Grady. I was present when he found the items. Muriel and I—” (Muriel gave a small wave) “—have been working with Lewis to empty the place.”

Blansky surveyed the group. “Who else has been inside?”

“We all have,” Lewis said.

Blansky’s voice softened. “From this point forward, the house is a crime scene. No one goes back in. No touching anything else. Understood?”

They nodded.

Blansky stood. “Then let’s go dig it up.”

The chairs scraped loudly against the tile as they rose. No one said much. Outside, the sun had the nerve to shine like it was just another day.

In the parking lot, Muriel glanced at Lewis. “Do you think he believed us?”

“We nailed it,” he said, watching the station door close behind them. “Five cold cases? It’s a windfall for a lot of people.”

He turned to Mike. “I know it’s been too long, but thank you for staying the course.”

* * *

On the drive back to the block where Hattie and Muriel lived, Lewis asked, “Hey, Hattie, it sounded like you’ve seen Detective Blansky recently. Was that about something else? Something I can help with?”

Muriel turned, eyes on Hattie in the back seat.

Hattie had to think fast. “Well, um… there was a strange incident involving a gun. A friend of mine had one. It was found, and my name came up as a character witness.”

“Wow. What did your friend do?”

“Absolutely nothing. Anyway, the whole matter was discharged.”

“Well, that’s good,” Lewis said, flashing her a wink in the rearview mirror. “Do you like your friend?”

Hattie blinked. What did he mean? What did he know? She straightened. “Now, Lewis, I’m not one to kiss and tell.”

Muriel jumped in smoothly. “Look at that pretty girl at the bus stop. Girls these days are stunning, don’t you think?”

And just like that, the conversation was hijacked. Hattie made a mental note to thank Muriel.


Chapter 57: Late Evening Machinations

Once home, with Muriel in tow, Hattie got out the Baileys and a pint of vanilla bean ice cream she’d been saving for someone to share it with. After two slugs of Baileys and a massive spoonful of ice cream, she had to pause.

“Oh, Muriel, what just happened? What an insane day. And I’m really sorry.”

“Sorry for what?”

“For dragging you into this. What if Mike had a gun?”

“Mike? Why would you think that?”

“He just showed up here, saying he needed to talk. I guess I got paranoid. And I didn’t have a gun. You could’ve gotten hurt. I wasn’t thinking.”

“I’m glad you called me. If something happened to you, it would’ve been... the worst of the worstest. Is that a thing?”

“Sure,” Hattie said. “Anyway, Mike’s story—can you imagine? That poor man.”

Muriel exhaled. “That Flynn guy... who knew he was such a sicko? Honestly, I’m glad he’s dead.”

Hattie felt the same and wondered. “Muriel, do you think Mike killed him?”

Muriel blinked. “To be honest, it crossed my mind.”

Hattie nodded. “Anyway, I’m glad we don’t have to go back there. If Flynn did kill all those girls... where are the bodies? It gives me chills.”

“Yeah. Bad juju, for sure,” Muriel said. “So I guess that’s it. We just wait and see what happens.”

Hattie nodded. There wasn’t much more they could do—except one thing. “We’ll have to tell Cartney.”

“Yes! Hey, let’s have her over for pizza. I’ll call her now.”

* * *

Cartney arrived within the hour, bursting through the front door with her usual flair. “Pizza and gossip? This better be good.” She dropped her bag and headed straight for the kitchen, helping herself to a scoop of vanilla bean.

“Cartney, you won’t believe today,” Muriel said, waving her spoon dramatically. “Seriously—it was bizonco bizarre.”

“She’s right,” Hattie said. “Mike showed up, desperate to talk. Turns out Flynn was not who we thought.”

Cartney froze mid-bite. “Flynn? As in, the guy found in the deep freeze?”

“Yes,” Hattie said gently. “He might’ve been responsible for several disappearances. Young women who went missing years ago. Mike thinks Flynn killed them.”

Cartney’s spoon clattered into the bowl. “Wait, what? Flynn—a serial killer? How did we miss that?”

Muriel shrugged. “No one saw it coming. We thought he was odd, maybe a little creepy... but not this. Anyway, we won’t be going back to the mansion. It’s a crime scene.”

Cartney sat back, frowning. “So why is Mike involved?”

Hattie’s voice softened. “One of the girls was his daughter. Her name was Rachel Carver.”

Cartney’s eyes widened. “Wait—wasn’t that the name in the library book?”

Muriel nodded. “Mike’s been looking for evidence for years. Since we’ve been there and he’s been hauling out stuff, he’s found tons of things. It’s heartbreaking.”

“And here I was, thinking Father John was the weird one.”

Hattie perked up. “Why do you say that?”

“The guy always showed up—like he knew where we were. He bugged the place, remember? And he took that ledger. And then, he most likely shot at himself with Hattie’s gun after stealing it! WTF.”

Muriel leaned in. “You’re right... What the heck is Father John up to?”

They turned to Hattie. “No clue.”


Chapter 58: A Curious Mind

That night, long after Muriel and Cartney had left, Hattie sat at the table with a weight in her gut. Rachel Carver.

She pushed the bowl aside, opened her laptop and began a search: Rachel Carver disappearance.

The screen’s glow lit her face as the search results loaded…then a hit.

A grainy scan of an old newspaper article from thirty years ago: “Fifteen-Year-Old Rachel Carver Missing After Leaving School Event. Authorities Say Foul Play Not Suspected.”

Hattie leaned in as her heart picked up. Rachel had left a book club meeting around 8 p.m. and was last seen walking home alone. No witnesses. No suspects. No Rachel.

She clicked the next link:

“Search for Missing Teen Slows, Family Pleads for Information.”

A younger Mike stared out from the screen, his grief still raw. The article noted how he’d stopped giving interviews soon after.

The following site loaded with a screech of clashing fonts and blinking ads. A blog.

“Rachel Carver and the Others: Coincidence or Pattern?”

Posted by someone calling themselves TruthHound42, the piece connected Rachel to two other missing girls. All teenagers. All vanished near downtown over two decades.

Hattie leaned in. A map. Pins. Lines. Patterns.

She kept going and found a memorial page hosted by Rachel’s old school. A yearbook photo flickered onto the screen—Rachel, wild-haired and bright-eyed, like she had the whole darn world ahead of her.

Caption: “She always said she wanted to be a librarian. She loved books more than people.”

Hattie sat back with fury, sorrow, and something else: resolve.

The truth would be a mixed blessing for the families. But for the girls—especially Rachel—it was long overdue.

Hattie closed the laptop. She rinsed her bowl, dried it, and slid it back into the cupboard.

Upstairs, she changed into her nightgown, brushed her teeth, and paused at the window. Black sky. Still trees. Somewhere out there, pieces of a buried story were stirring.

She climbed into bed, trying to breathe herself to sleep. Her body softened, eyes closed—

Buzz-buzz-buzz.

Her phone jolted on the nightstand. She groaned, reached for it, then froze.

Motion detected—mansion camera.

Hattie sat upright. Glasses on. Phone unlocked.

First floor—empty.

She tapped to the second floor.

There. Winston Barr. Clear as day, walking toward the camera, then veering right—into Flynn’s mother’s room.

She stared at the screen. Breath caught. Pulse thumping.

She waited. Watched.

Nothing.

She meant to stay awake. Meant to see him leave. But at some point, exhaustion won.

The phone slipped from her hand.

And the house went quiet.

* * *

She was awoken by her phone.

“Hello?”

“I’ve been calling you,” Muriel said. “Did you see it last night?”

“Yes.”

“After you didn’t answer, I called Lewis. It was a setup.”

“Setup by who?”

“Lewis. He’s on a mission for DNA. He won’t stop. He’s been talking with that Lainey person about how there’s no confirmed photo showing Mrs. Elwood with her half-brother and herself. Then, whenever he brings it up, Winston breaks in and plants one. Same doctored photo, same frame. We’re up to three now.”

“Three?”

“You got the first one. Cartney picked up the second when she went to get Mrs. Elwood’s hairbrush. Now there’s probably a third left on the bedside table last night. Lewis says the more fake photos he collects, the better the odds of picking up usable DNA from Winston and Postman.”

Hattie blinked. “How many pictures will they plant before realizing something’s up?”

Muriel scoffed. “Clearly, they’re not the brightest bulbs on the tree. Lewis keeps telling Postman that workers in the mansion are throwing out stuff daily. It’s the perfect cover.”

Hattie shook her head. “But how did Winston get in? I thought the locks were changed.”

“They were. But the outside cameras caught Winston entering through the kitchen window.”

Suddenly, Hattie had a thought. “Hey, listen, is there a way I can see the exterior camera footage?”

“Sure. I’ll send you a link. But why? What are you looking for?”

“I don’t know yet.” Hattie’s eyes narrowed. “I just have a feeling.”


Chapter 59: Touching Base

The video from the night before was remarkably clear. A white sedan pulled onto the mansion’s long gravel drive, headlights bouncing along.

The first camera, mounted near the front gate, caught the vehicle as it rolled in. Hattie leaned closer.

The glare from the headlights made the front license unreadable, and the rear plate was shadowed just enough to blur the numbers. She paused, zoomed in, and adjusted the contrast—nothing. There were still smears with no discernible numbers.

The second camera picked up the car as it reached the fork in the driveway and veered right toward the back of the mansion, just steps from the kitchen entrance.

Then, the third camera, mounted above the back door, caught the most precise shot.

The sedan slowed and came to a stop. The brake lights lit up—but only on the driver’s side. The passenger side brake light stayed dark.

Hattie restarted the video and watched it again. Yes, the brake light was out.

When the driver’s door opened, a man stepped out wearing gloves, a cap, and a bulky jacket. He quickly climbed the back stairs, moved to a far window, lifted the sash, and disappeared inside. Thankfully, the indoor hall cameras caught up with him, Winston Barr. There was no mistaking him.

On a slip of paper, she wrote: Barr, R brake light

He picked the wrong place if he thought he could sneak onto Flynn’s property and plant fake evidence without being seen. Fool.

Then she came up with an idea.

She called her friend. After three rings, his voice came through. “And to what do I owe this honorable call?”

Hattie smiled. “I guess you’re just lucky. Listen, I was wondering if you could take me for a ride somewhere. At your convenience.”

“When you say somewhere, is that anywhere or someplace specific like Baja California?”

“It’s a bar about twenty minutes away.”

“A bar, you say? Hmm, at 11 AM. Intriguing… You may suspect I’m swamped and have to check my schedule. Let’s see where’s my to-do list… I got it. Okay, I have to change the water in the aquarium, check the calendar for the next recycling day, and then deal with Specks. After eating a can of sardines for breakfast, he tossed most of it on the rug. I have some rice cooking on the stove... so let me think… I can be at your place in about an hour. How does that sound?”

“Are you sure?”

“Yup.”

“Feel free to bring Specks.”

“Specks? Car?” he asked. The dog barked. “We’ll be there.”

* * *

The Red Dog sat just beyond the mansion’s gates, low and unassuming, like a place that had never pretended to be more than it was. As Horatio parked, Hattie eyed the building, its paint weathered by wind. A neon beer sign buzzed in the window.

Inside, it was quiet. A few early regulars sat at the bar. The jukebox was silent, and the smell of bacon grease lingered faintly in the air.

Hattie walked up to the bar. The man behind it wore a Red Dog hoodie and glasses shoved into a messy patch of hair. He looked at her over the rim of a chipped coffee mug.

Hattie put on her best smile. “Hello, young man. Are you the owner?”

“Manager,” he said, setting the mug down. “Name’s Larry. What can I do for you?”

“I was wondering,” Hattie said casually, “if I could take a quick look at your outdoor camera footage from the night of that big March storm. The twenty-second.”

Larry raised an eyebrow. “You with the police?”

“Not officially. I’m helping them out. I’m with the same crew that’s over at the Flynn place.”

His eyes narrowed slightly, but not unfriendly. “You got a warrant?”

“No,” Hattie said. “But I do have an appetite. My friend and I plan to stay for lunch—grilled cheese and fries, maybe a soda. Would that be possible?”

Larry snorted. “So you want to poke around my camera system and pay me in grilled cheese?”

“With fries,” she added, smiling. “And we’ll leave a generous tip.”

He paused, then jerked a finger toward the back. “Come around. Just don’t break anything.”

“Scout’s honor,” Hattie said.

Horatio waved from the bar. “I’ll man the ship.”

Larry led Hattie into a small back office cluttered with receipts, a coffee maker, and a dusty Red Dog dartboard. A monitor sat on the desk, running the security feed software.

“Here’s your control panel,” he said, pointing to the screen. “Cam four is the one out front. Scroll with this and add the date and time in the box. It will search and show the times and dates over here... Got it?”

Hattie nodded. “Yes. Thank you.”

“Knock yourself out,” he said. Then, smirking, he pointed to a small dome camera in the ceiling corner. “Just remember—you’re on tape, too. Say cheese.”

Hattie grinned. “Wouldn’t dream of taking anything. Just here to see if a car left the Flynn’s property that night.”

After the bartender left, Hattie punched in the date and time and hit enter. The snowy night filled the screen. It was grainy when suddenly headlights appeared and made a right from the mansion’s driveway, passing in front of the bar. Her eyes fell on the timestamp: 7:35 PM.

As the white car pulled away from the Red Dog, one brake light lit red and the other stayed dark. She leaned in. “That’s his car.”


Chapter 60: Mini Investigation

With lunch set up in a far corner, Horatio leaned forward. “So what are we doing here?”

Hattie screwed up her face. “Having lunch. How are the fries?”

“Not bad. Especially with vinegar... Will you clue me in, or should we play charades?”

“Right.” Hattie wiped her mouth. “Well, you know how you go into the kitchen looking for your coffee cup, and halfway there, you forget why you’re heading in—and start wondering where your glasses are? And then you realize they’re already on your head? Not one pair. Two?”

She paused. Horatio looked confused.

“Has this ever happened to you?”

He shook his head. “Not that I can remember.”

“Well, of course, you wouldn’t remember. That’s kind of the point of not remembering.”

“I’m wondering if we should have a drink.”

“Certainly. Feel free,” Hattie said. “I’ll have to pass, though. Must keep my wits.” She leaned in. “I need some advice.”

“Great.” He raised a hand and called over to the bartender. “A draft, please.” Then, turning back to her, “What’s the problem?”

“Okay, I’m kinda involved with an investigation. Well, at this point, no one’s aware of what I’m doing.”

“You mean you’re taking me into your confidence? I’m honored.”

She smiled. “There was a terrible snowstorm a couple of months ago. A man died from exposure. He lived nearby, was older, and had dementia. Apparently wandered off, got stranded, and froze several miles away. Any thoughts so far?”

“I’m wondering when the bartender plans to serve me.”

Hattie glanced at Larry, who was watching a basketball game. “Hmm. Yes. So what does one do—ask again or get up and make yourself a nuisance? Tough call.” She resumed eating.

“That’s it? You’re stopping the conversation?”

“You don’t seem interested. That’s okay.”

“Who are you?” His tone was kind. “We’re supposed to banter.”

Hattie shrugged.

“Okay, my thoughts. Let’s see—how old was this man?”

“Mid-sixties. Never married. Lived alone. No real friends or family.”

“Did he have pets?”

“Huh?”

“You know, like a dog or a cat.”

“No.”

“Who found him?”

“A man walking his dog. The body was in a field. Most of the snow had melted by then.”

“What was the question, again?”

“I’ll be more specific. Do you think he died from exposure, or was he murdered?”

“How many miles from here?”

“Four.”

Horatio leaned back in his chair. “I’d say both.”

“Both what?”

“Clearly, he was murdered from exposure.”

“What makes you say that?”

“The coroner would’ve concluded exposure. But how could a man with dementia walk four miles in a storm like that?”

“Exactly!” Hattie said. “He was taken there!”

“Did I do good?”

“Very good. Now, just one more itty-bitty question. Let’s say, for argument’s sake, I have information—unverified—about who the murderer might be. Should I keep investigating or go to the police?”

“Can you be more specific?”

“Okay. I know someone in his car left the dead man’s house the night of the storm. Should I try to piece together the man’s route—or report what I know?”

“Go to the police.”

“Why?”

“All they need is a warrant and access to the guy’s phone records. That should tell them everything.”

“Seriously?”

“God’s truth.” He stood. “If that’s the end of listening to my thoughts, I’m going to the bar for a little reminder. When I get back, you’ll have to tell me your thoughts. Deal or no deal?”

Hattie smiled. “I’ll think about it.”

Horatio returned with his beer, foam cresting the rim. He took a sip, then looked at her more seriously than before.

“One thing,” he said. “Are you safe?”

Hattie waved a fry in the air like a tiny flag. “Please. I can take care of myself.”

He didn’t argue. Just watched her a moment, then nodded slowly and took another sip.


Chapter 61: Gone

The following day, Hattie spent her time cleaning and humming little tunes. Di, dity, didi. And she knew why—spending time with Horatio had been more fun than a barrel of corgis.

After lunch, they’d gone to the zoo, fed the ducks, and, oddly enough, slipped into a church to light candles. Sitting in a pew, watching the colored light pour through the stained glass, Hattie felt something shift inside her—something soft and wordless. Maybe it was peace. Or perhaps just the surprise of feeling companioned.

She was scrubbing a stubborn bit of stovetop when Cartney let herself in through the back door.

“You decent?” Cartney called.

“Barely,” Hattie hollered back, tossing the sponge into the sink. “If you’d come five minutes earlier, you’d have caught me serenading the toaster.”

Cartney stepped into the kitchen with a paper bag dangling from one hand. “I brought those lemon tarts you like.”

“Well, now,” Hattie said, wiping her hands on a dishtowel. “Either you want something, or you’re about to drop some news.”

Cartney placed the bag on the table. “I didn’t want to tell you over the phone. Father John has left the church.”

Hattie froze. “Left? As in… left?”

“He’s on extended sabbatical.” Cartney pulled out a chair. “I saw it in the paper. It was a small notice at the bottom of page three, under Community Announcements. Just said he was taking a personal sabbatical. No return date.”

Hattie sat slowly. “Page three? That’s where they put missing cats and senior Zumba.”

“Exactly.” Cartney nodded. “Slipped in like it didn’t matter.”

“Thanks for the tarts. And the news,” Hattie said, though her mind was already spinning.

After Cartney left, she wandered back into the kitchen, poured a second cup of tea, and opened her laptop. She typed in Father John sabbatical on the local paper’s website. And there it was:

Father John Takes Leave from St. Dominic’s

Reverend John McCarthy of St. Dominic’s Church has announced a personal sabbatical effective immediately. The pastor has served the parish for over 30 years. In a brief statement, he expressed gratitude to the congregation and noted a need for private reflection and renewal. No return date has been provided. Pastoral duties will be temporarily covered by visiting clergy from the diocese.

Hattie stared at the screen. “Well,” she murmured, “I do wish you well, Father John. But why so sudden? Why so quiet?”

The questions itched at her.

* * *

The next day, unable to leave it alone, she picked up the phone and called St. Dominic’s.

“Good morning, St. Dominic’s,” said a warm voice. “This is Sister Catherine.”

“Hello, Sister,” Hattie said, carefully polite. “I was wondering if you might know when Father John is expected to return?”

A pause. Just long enough to raise suspicion.

“Oh… Father John won’t be returning.”

“You mean not soon?”

“I mean at all,” Sister Catherine said gently. “He’s stepped down. He’s left the Church.”

Hattie’s throat tightened. “The Church as in…?”

“The priesthood,” the Sister clarified. “It was his decision. We were all surprised, but he made it clear it was time to go.”

After a quiet “Thank you”, Hattie hung up and sat in the stillness of her kitchen.

Not a sabbatical. Not a break. Disappeared from the life he’d lived for decades. And with it, everything he knew.

She told herself to let it go. But later that day, she searched for Father John on Facebook. Tucked inside a thread between two parishioners was another announcement:

Former Catholic Priest Enters Buddhist Monastery

John McCarthy has joined a Zen Buddhist monastery in northern Vermont. According to sources at the retreat center, he has entered a period of deep study and contemplation with the intent to become a monk. “He’s seeking clarity,” said one fellow practitioner.

At first, Hattie liked the image—Father John in robes, walking among pine trees, sweeping temple steps, searching for something pure.

But why the abrupt exit? She had lingering questions that would never be answered: Why had he taken the ledger, bugged the library, and stolen her gun?

She whispered into the room. “Orin, give me a hand, will you? Take your time. There’s no hurry.


Chapter 62: Lunch at the Mercury Club

In the parking lot, Lewis gave us a rundown.

“Okay. I want Aunt Hattie to come in with me. Muriel, you’ll be my secretary, and Cartney, my Girl Friday. Let’s go in a few minutes apart so they don’t get suspicious or overwhelmed. Check?”

Everyone responded. “Check.”

“Now, as I bring up the different topics, I’ll refer to the goods. That includes the camera stills, framed photos, and the DNA results. I have everything in my briefcase if they demand to see any of it.”

A huge smile broke across Lewis’s face. “Man, I can’t wait. These people have been hounding me, and now it’s time for them to squirm… Am I enjoying this too much?”

Muriel patted his arm. “No, Honeyboo, enjoyment is never too much.”

He squeezed her hand and looked around the parking lot. “I don’t see anyone familiar. I’ll head out with Hattie. Remember, it’s the table for Lewis on the third floor.”

Once out of the car, Lewis placed Hattie’s arm in the crook of his elbow. She felt like a queen and stood a little taller.

* * *

The elevator opened with a quiet ding, the kind that didn’t announce but whispered. The third floor was hushed. A waiter in a starched white jacket nodded without smiling and gestured toward a corner table draped in thick linen the color of clotted cream.

Lewis guided her past oil portraits in gilded frames—men with stern faces, mustaches, monocles, and a terrible lack of humor. The ceilings were high and coffered. With each step, her feet sank into the thick Oriental carpet.

She counted at least three men in tailored suits reading actual newspapers. Not phones. Not laptops. Newspapers—creased and rustling like the old days. One man sipped something amber from a short glass.

Hattie leaned into Lewis. “I feel a little out of place.”

He smiled. “Don’t worry. You belong here more than they do.”

She wasn’t sure about that but lifted her chin anyway.

At his table, Lewis pulled out her chair, treating her like a duchess. She sat slowly, one eye on the door, and smoothed the napkin across her lap. As the waiter approached, a familiar woman followed behind.

Lainey Postman. At last, face to face.

She wore a fitted black suit that projected both respect and control. Her hair was pulled into a high ponytail that fluttered around her face and shoulders. Her makeup was subtle, except for the smoky eyes—too dramatic for lunch, in Hattie’s opinion.

“Hello, Lewis,” Lainey said somewhat distractedly, her eyes landing on Hattie.

Hattie was already having fun.

Lewis stood and pulled out Lainey’s chair. “This is my Aunt Hattie. She just came to Buffalo for a quick visit. I didn’t want to cancel, so I brought her along. Is that all right?”

A sweet smile flitted across Lainey’s lips. “No problem.”

“Wonderful, because I know you’ve been waiting for my decision, and I didn’t want to keep you in the dark. Please sit and order a drink. I’m expecting a few more people.”

“Who?” she asked, her tone dismissive.

“Two people from my staff and—” Lewis glanced at the entrance. “Perfect timing. Here he comes. Winston Barr. He’s also expressed interest in the estate.”

Hattie watched Lainey closely. No surprise. Of course not. The two were in cahoots.

As Winston approached, his eyes locked onto Lainey.

Lewis smiled. “Mr. Barr, do you know Ms. Postman?”

“Umm,” the man said. “No, I don’t believe so.” He extended a hand. “Nice to meet you.”

The handshake was quick. Barely a glance exchanged.

Lewis clapped his hands together. “My staff appears to be running late. I’m sure they won’t be long. Shall we order drinks?”

They both declined. Silence settled in, thick and awkward.

Lewis continued, trying to ease the tension, “Winston, this is my Aunt Hattie. We’ll be going to the waterfront after lunch. As I was telling Ms. Postman, the probate issues on the property are finally cleared, and I didn’t want either of you to wait any longer.”

He checked his watch. “Let me give my staff a call.”

By the time he reached an empty corner of the room, Muriel’s voice drifted in from the hallway.

“Hells bells, this place reminds me of my time in London. Do you think they have shepherd’s pie?”

Cartney mumbled something.

“Oh, my dear, it’s absolutely the best. Sautéed lamb… or something, with mashed potatoes on top. Great for us ladies without teeth.”

More mumbling.

“What? You don’t have teeth either? But how’s that possible? You’re only in your twenties.”

Then, the two women appeared in the doorway.

Muriel’s eyes lit up. She waved. “Coming! Sorry, we’re late.”

A flurry of introductions followed, and soon everyone was seated.

“Drinks?” the waiter asked.

“Yes,” Lewis said. “Let’s have a nice bottle of wine for the table—Pinot Noir. We’ll order food later. Thank you.”

Lewis straightened in his chair, folded his hands, and smiled. “Well, now. Where should I start…”

Hattie glanced around the table. Everyone appeared calm. Poised. But the air buzzed. The game was on.

Lewis leaned in. “Ms. Postman, I’m very sorry, but after evaluating the mountain of information you’ve given me to establish your relationship with Mr. Elwood, I must decline your claim.”

She opened her mouth, but he held up a hand.

“Regrettably, I believe you've been duped.”

“Duped? By who? I don’t understand.”

He shrugged lightly. “That’s the question. I’m not sure. All I know is that inside many families, there are mountains of lies, misconceptions, and stories. Where people come from, who’s what to whom—it’s sometimes more fiction than truth. And that appears to be the problem in your case. Now, I don’t doubt your sincerity, but I suspect—for reasons I can't fathom—that the documents and stories given to you about your birth are forgeries.”

Her eyebrows knitted together. “That’s not possible. With all due respect, you need to have those materials evaluated properly. They’ve been in the family for years—”

He raised his hand again. “It’s not about the documents, photographs, or even the diaries you brought me. It’s about your DNA.”

Her face tightened. “DNA? What DNA?”

Lewis opened his briefcase. “It simply doesn’t match,” he said flatly.

“What are you saying? What the hell are you talking about? You don’t have my DNA.”

“Actually, Ms. Postman, I’ve been collecting samples from your wine glasses during our lunches. I had them tested multiple times and compared them with samples from the deceased and his mother. You are not related in any way.”

Her face flushed crimson. “You have no right to—”

“I’m afraid I do. Please feel free to contact an attorney, but be aware: if you’ve forged documents or stolen someone’s identity, the legal consequences could be significant.”

Her eyes flicked toward Barr, whose face had gone pale.

“Well, I don’t have to tolerate this disrespect.”

She pushed her chair back, about to stand, when Lewis leaned forward, his voice velvet smooth. “There’s more to this. You may want to hear what you’re up against.”

She hesitated. And stayed seated.

Lewis turned to Barr. “My friend, it’s now your turn.”

Barr lifted a single eyebrow, the only visible twitch of nerves.

Lewis reached into his briefcase and pulled out the three framed photographs from Mrs. Elwood’s bedroom. He lined them up across the table.

“Look familiar?”


Chapter 63: Leaving So Soon?

Winston Barr glanced at the framed pictures. “Am I supposed to know what these are?”

“Mr. Barr,” Lewis said, folding his hands, “do you know we have cameras in the mansion?”

“How would I know?”

“Exactly. You wouldn’t know,” Lewis replied, his voice calm and measured. “Unfortunately for you, we do have cameras. Multiple. And they’ve captured quite a bit, like you entering the house without authorization. More than once. You were seen going into Mrs. Elwood’s bedroom… repeatedly.”

Winston opened his mouth, then closed it.

Lewis continued, “And as if that weren’t enough, we also have evidence linking you to the staged photographs of Ms. Postman, conveniently placed around the home to establish her legitimacy. What you attempted was a false history—a visual lie.”

He tapped the glass of the first frame.

“These aren’t just forgeries. They’re laughable. Lighting inconsistencies, digital seams, backgrounds that don’t match the house’s decor—past or present. You must have rushed them.”

Winston shifted in his seat, reached for his water glass, but didn’t drink.

“Do you see the problem?” Lewis asked. “Or should I say… deep concern?”

Silence followed, heavy with implication.

Hattie watched Winston closely. His jaw twitched. A bead of sweat formed at his temple and began its slow descent.

Muriel, unbothered, buttered a roll with casual precision. “Better than popcorn,” she whispered to Cartney.

Winston leaned forward, voice tight. “You can’t accuse me like this. This is slander. I’m an interested party. I was invited into that house.”

Lewis cocked his head. “Invited? By whom?”

Winston blinked. “I—I don’t remember. The door was open.”

“Open doors don’t equal open access,” Lewis said. “But that’s beside the point. The frames, the glass, and these photographs…” He tapped the one in the center. “…were dusted for prints.”

Winston’s mouth tightened.

“And those same prints were compared to known samples from shots of whiskey I had shared with people in my office. Would you like to know whose fingerprints we found?” Lewis asked, lifting a brow.

No answer. Just the soft clink of silverware in the distance.

“Yours, of course,” Lewis continued. “But what really delighted the forensics team? We also found Ms. Postman’s.”

Lainey sat up straighter. “That’s impossible,” she blurted.

Lewis turned toward her, sympathy gone. “Funny since, up until now, you and Mr. Barr didn’t know each other.”

“I don’t know him,” Lainey snapped. “And I certainly don’t know how my prints would be on anything. That makes no sense.”

“Oh, I agree,” Lewis said. “Unless someone got sloppy. Maybe handed you the photos. Asked your opinion. Maybe you slipped them into frames together. Or maybe… you were both in the room. At the same time.”

Lainey’s eyes flicked toward Winston. That flick was all Hattie needed to see.

“Uh ho,” Muriel muttered, “we’ve got collusion at the clotted cream table.”

Cartney stifled a grin.

Hattie stayed quiet, watching Lainey. The woman’s lipstick remained perfect, but something behind it—a carefully constructed poise—was beginning to crack.

Lewis sat back. “So. Before we move on, let me ask again. Mr. Barr. Ms. Postman. Are you sure you don’t know each other?”

Winston gave Lainey a look—a strange mix of panic and pleading—but she didn’t return it. Her eyes stayed in a frozen vague stare.

Lewis continued. “Because if either of you lied, you’re facing more than a property dispute. Coordinated fraud. Falsification of evidence. Unlawful entry. This isn’t just unethical—it’s criminal. And when the authorities review the footage, the prints, the timeline—”

Chairs scraped.

Lainey stood first, jaw tight, hands trembling slightly as she reached for her bag. Winston followed, pale, ashen.

“We’re leaving,” Lainey said. “This whole thing is a setup.”

“No lunch?” Muriel said. “But the  Pinot’s breathing.”

They didn’t reply. Only walked on, with Lainey in the lead and Winston following behind.

The hush in the room deepened as the faint whisper of the elevator doors slid shut.

Cartney leaned in. “So… is now a bad time to say I’m starving?”

Muriel burst out laughing, reaching for the bread basket. “Honestly, that was better than matinee theater.”

Lewis exhaled slowly, managing a tight smile. “That went about as expected.”

“You knew they’d run?” Hattie asked.

“I thought they might bluff longer,” Lewis said. “But they saw the net closing and bolted. DNA, fingerprints, footage—it was too much. They were hoping to intimidate their way through.”

Muriel nodded. “Lainey might’ve pulled it off solo. She had the look, the sob story, the mystery hair. But Winston? Please. His poker face couldn’t bluff a two-year-old.”

“They’ll lawyer up,” Cartney said. “You ready for that?”

“Let them. They’ve got no legal leg to stand on. And if they try, I’ll bring in the police.”

A cool breeze slipped through the high windows, ruffling the tablecloth’s edges. Hattie closed her eyes and let it wash over her. Something had shifted. Not just the case—but Lewis too. He looked lighter. Calmer. His shoulders looser.

“So what now?” Hattie asked.

Lewis grinned. “Now? Now we order lunch.”

He waved to the waiter with the air of a man who had earned it.

Twenty minutes later, the food arrived. Hattie took a slow bite of buttery salmon, savoring the richness. Around her, laughter. It steadied her. She lifted her glass. “To doing what needed doing—and letting the truth speak for itself.”

The glasses clinked in quiet celebration and justice served.


Chapter 64: Unearthed

“I’ll get right to it,” Blansky said. “The forensic team finished going through the mansion and grounds. The evidence is overwhelming.”

Hattie’s stomach tightened. She glanced at Mike, reached for his arm, and squeezed it. He laid his hot, sweaty hand over hers.

Lordy. Keep breathing.

“They went over the mansion inch by inch,” the detective began, his tone dry and deliberate. “Without being too specific, we found biological evidence—Hair. Blood. Skin cells. Multiple DNA sources—all matched to the missing women.”

Muriel gasped.

“If you want to learn more, you can review these reports. Trigger warning, they are not for the faint of heart.”

No one breathed. Hattie’s stomach turned.

He closed the folder. “We’re building a timeline. But make no mistake—we’re already calling it. Flynn was not just a person of interest. He was the man responsible for all their deaths. Questions?”

Mike spoke up. “Did you find any remains?”

“In the cellar, there were several suspicious mounds,” Blansky continued, his voice steady, official. “One was an irregular concrete pour. We broke it open.”

He paused, giving them a moment.

“Inside, we recovered five sets of remains. Some were partial, others more intact. We ran mitochondrial DNA from the bones against samples we got from family members.” He looked at Mike. “Thank you for helping us. After we spoke last night, I forgot to thank you for all your help.”

Mike didn’t flinch. His face collapsed inward, folding into itself. Still, he nodded. A man trying to stay upright on a sinking boat.

“There were also dental records for two of the others that matched medical records we obtained from their families.”

Hattie closed her eyes and said a little prayer for the women.

“We documented everything,” Blansky said, pulling a stack of photographs and forms from a folder. “If anyone wants to see.”

Cartney was the only one to reach over and slowly flip through the stack. The images didn’t pass hands; they didn’t need to.

Lewis remained stoic and said nothing—just blinked hard and swallowed.

“Any more questions?” Blansky asked.

Hattie thought of something. “What about all those suspicious medications found in the house?

Detective Blansky let out a slow breath. “The forensic team ruled out arsenic—no trace in the bones, teeth, or what little hair remained. But that’s where the certainty ends. Tissue degradation over so many years means they can’t rule out morphine, laudanum, or even chloroform. All three metabolize quickly and evaporate over time. Without preserved tissue or a sealed scene, there’s nothing left to test. What we do have, however, are Flynn Elwood’s fingerprints on an old morphine syringe and the stopper of a chloroform bottle found upstairs.” He looked up, eyes flat.

Hattie glanced at Mike. The poor man’s face had turned ashen. He stared at the table, unmoving, until he looked up. “So he gets away with all that horror and no accountability.” He pushed back his chair and stood abruptly. “I need to organize something. A memorial. For the girls. For their families. Somebody needs to say their names out loud. They deserve that—at the very least.”

We all nodded. Even amid the horror, Mike Grady was a man of action.

“Yes. Of course,” said Blansky. “Call me in a couple of days for their contact information. I’ll let them know they’ll be hearing from you.”

Hattie and the others watched him go. No one said a word. The air felt heavier now, like the truth had left them in the quiet wreckage.

Lewis cleared his throat. “I’ve spoken to a couple of people,” he said. “Attorneys. Estate folks. The City. Once I get the okay from the detective, the families will be contacted and encouraged to file a wrongful death suit against Flynn’s estate. Every last asset. House, land, funds. Whatever else holds value… and I want that place torn down. The mansion. Every brick. We don’t need another shadow sitting on that hill.”

Blansky gave a quiet, solemn nod. “It’s under city jurisdiction now. Once the legal wheels turn, it can be condemned.”

“I’ve already drafted a proposal,” Lewis said. “The city will take over the land. Make it into a green space. No plaques. No markers. Just trees, flowers, open sky. Let the place breathe again.”

Muriel let out a long sigh and made the sign of the cross.

For the first time since the truth came out, Hattie felt the tiniest flicker of peace. Not because things were fixed—they never would be—but because the decision was made to reclaim the land and allow new growth.

As silence continued to fill the room, Hattie stood. “There’s one last matter I’d like to bring up.”

Everyone turned.

“I’m not sure how you’ll feel about it, but I’d like to bring it to the detective’s attention.”

They looked at Hattie expectantly.

She took a deep breath. “I think Flynn was murdered.”

Silence. Thicker this time.

“Yes, I know this might not be worth pursuing, given the kind of man he was. But still... I’m not sure there’s such a thing as an innocent murderer. I’ll respect your decision. Should I go on?”

Detective Blansky was the first to speak. “Of course.”

“I believe Winston Barr and Lainey Postman killed Flynn Elwood. These people have already tried to petition the estate lawyer, claiming to be Flynn’s only living relatives.”

Blansky turned to Lewis. “Were you aware of this?”

“I knew about their fraudulent claims,” Lewis said. “Not about any murder.”

Blansky turned back. “What led you to this conclusion, Mrs. Moon?”

“I saw a video recently from a camera Lewis installed at the mansion,” she said. “Mr. Barr’s car was in the driveway, and as it turned behind the house, I noticed that the brake light was broken. Later, I went to the Red Dog Bar adjacent to the Elwood Mansion. The manager let me review their cameras. On the night of the storm, I saw that same car exit the mansion’s driveway, turn right in front of the Red Dog, and drive off. The footage was date and time-stamped, and the car was also missing the passenger side brake light.”

Hattie paused. The room was still.

“A friend suggested that while I can’t prove guilt or innocence, your department might be able to obtain a warrant. Check Mr. Barr’s and Ms. Postman’s phone records to see if their devices traveled from the mansion to where Flynn’s body was found on that night.”

Hattie glanced around the room, suddenly concerned. She hadn’t told anyone what she’d done. “I’m sorry,” she said quietly. “I didn’t mean to go behind anyone’s back.”

Lewis was the first to respond. “Hattie,” he said, “we’re proud of you.”


Chapter 65: Demolition

They stood behind the yellow caution tape, close enough to feel the tremble of machinery through the soles of their shoes. The old Elwood mansion loomed above them for the last time.

Beside Hattie, Cartney zipped up her jacket. Muriel sighed. “I thought I’d feel better.” Lewis stood silent on the other side of her, their arms entwined.

A backhoe groaned to life. The engine rattled through Hattie’s chest. It trundled forward and swung its long steel arm toward a side wall—like a giant’s elbow crashing down. Bricks burst apart. A section collapsed.

“Oh…” Cartney began to say. Her voice got lost in the crumble and roar.

Hattie reached for her hand. Cartney’s fingers were cold and rigid at first, then softened slightly in Hattie’s.

The machine paused, repositioning.

“You okay?” Hattie asked.

Cartney gave a slight nod but didn’t speak.

Hattie glanced at Lewis. He hadn’t moved. Just stared. His eyes were red-rimmed behind his glasses. He’d wanted this—fought for it. Still, watching something die, even something ugly, didn’t always feel like victory.

“They should’ve burned it,” Muriel muttered. “Straight to ash. Salt the ground.”

No one answered. A gust of wind kicked up dust as if the ground flinched.

The backhoe slammed again—this time into the east wall. A groan echoed through the bones of the house. Shingles flew up, twisting in the air.

“You ever think,” Cartney murmured, “that the house knew?”

“Knew what?” Hattie asked gently.

“What he did. What it was hiding.”

Hattie glanced at the windows—those black, hollow eyes staring out at nothing. “Maybe it held its breath all these years until someone would listen. Maybe now, the house is free as well.”

Another crash. Another wall gave out.

“It’s weird,” Cartney said, finally turning toward her. “Part of me wanted to see it burn. But now... I just want it gone.”

“Same,” Hattie said. “It’ll be green space soon. Just light.”

“Do you think that’s enough?” Cartney asked.

Hattie didn’t answer right away. A crossbeam slid sideways and slammed into the dirt like a thunderclap.

“No,” she said finally. “Not enough. But maybe it’s a start.”

Cartney nodded.

Muriel turned away first. “I’ve seen what I need to see.” Her voice was tight.

Lewis touched her elbow gently, steadying her as they stepped back.

Hattie stayed a moment longer with Cartney, watching the last standing wall collapse in a cloud of dust and memory.

The machine went quiet. The air settled.

“I didn’t cry,” Cartney said softly.

“You don’t have to,” Hattie replied.

They stood in silence, side by side, facing the wreckage. It wasn’t an empty silence—it was full of everything left unsaid, everything that still needed time.

And for Hattie, that was what healing looked like. Not fireworks. Not tears. Just standing together as the past came down and a new start began.


Chapter 66: A Confession

It was mid-afternoon when Hattie spotted Father John through the front window. He was walking to the house in sandals, loose trousers, and a simple ochre robe. His head was shaved. His hands rested lightly on his sleeves—no collar, no bag—just him.

Two days earlier, he messaged her on Facebook, asking if he could visit and saying he had something to give her. They arranged a time; he’d come to her home.

Her pulse quickened as she opened the door before he could knock.

“You,” she said, blinking hard.

“Me,” he replied with a quiet smile.

They stood for a beat in the doorway, a gentle breeze catching the corner of her apron. The scent of rising yeast drifted from the kitchen—she’d been baking all afternoon, trying to distract herself.

“I have tea,” she offered finally.

“I hoped you would.”

They settled at her kitchen table, sunlight angling across the worn wood. Silence drifted between them—somewhere between awkward and uncertain. Hattie poured his tea, watching him closely. He looked thinner as if someone had plucked away the burdens that used to weigh him down—yet a different heaviness lingered behind his eyes.

“You left,” she said plainly, her voice catching. “Without a word.”

He exhaled, glancing at his tea. “I didn’t know how to explain it.”

“You could’ve tried.”

“I wasn’t ready,” he said quietly. “I was barely holding myself together.”

She leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. “And now? You’re a monk?”

“I’m becoming one,” he answered. “Technically, I’m still a postulant. It’ll be years before I’m ordained—assuming I continue down that path.”

She studied the shaved crown of his head. “You—of all people—walked away from the Church. Just like that?”

“Not just like that,” he said. “It was breaking me. I was complicit in things I didn’t fully understand.”

Her voice sharpened. “Like Flynn?”

His eyes dropped to his tea. “I knew he was troubled. But I didn’t see how deep it ran. I should have asked harder questions.”

“He confessed to you, didn’t he?”

“I can’t speak to that.”

“Still hiding behind the seal?” she pressed.

He looked up, exhaustion etched in his face. “Still honoring a promise I made before I understood its cost.”

Silence settled again. Hattie felt a swirl of anger and heartbreak—but also a flicker of curiosity.

“Why Buddhism?” she asked softly.

He took a slow breath. “Because it teaches me to sit with the pain. Not solve it, not redeem it—witness it. That’s what I need right now.”

She examined him a moment longer. “You look...empty.”

He offered a faint nod. “I feel empty.”

For a moment, neither of them spoke. Then Hattie reached across the table, laying her hand over his. His fingers were cold and thin.

“Do you have questions for me?” he asked.

Suddenly, a door opened. Where to begin? “I do,” she replied. “What was your relationship with Flynn?”

“It was complicated.”

“In what way?”

He pulled the ledger from beneath his robe and placed it on the table.

She stared at the worn cover, recognizing it instantly—Flynn’s financial ledger, the one that had vanished from the evidence pile. “I don’t understand.”

“I’m sorry I took it,” he said. “I just... didn’t want to be implicated in any way.”

He hesitated, glancing toward the window. Then his gaze returned to hers. “Flynn was not a nice person. He manipulated everyone—me included.”

Hattie watched him closely, half-worried he’d spin himself into a victim. But she saw the anguish carving fine lines near his mouth.

“I knew about the murders,” he said, voice hushed. “He confessed them to me. One at a time, I listened. And each time, he promised it wouldn’t happen again—until he flipped the script. I guess he feared I might go to the police. And I should have.”

“But you didn’t,” she said evenly, anger rising in her chest.

“No.” He rubbed a hand over his scalp, eyes dark. “I didn’t. I was torn because of the oath I’d taken. Confessions are sacred between penitent and priest—”

“More women died.” Her voice was thick with accusation.

He closed his eyes briefly. “Yes. And before I realized it, Flynn played me like a puppet.” He tapped the ledger with his knuckles. “These notations and money transfers? They are not donations from Flynn to the Church. They were my payments to him to keep him quiet.”

She frowned. “You’re saying he blackmailed you? What could he have had on you?”

“That was the thing—I didn’t know,” he said wearily. “He told me he had planted evidence that I participated in his... hobbies. That’s what he called the murders. And that if he were caught, I’d be with him. I was desperate to protect myself—and the Church. I kept him in God’s grace until he no longer needed confession. Then he found other ways to tighten his grip.”

Hattie’s stomach turned. “What kind of evidence did he claim to have?”

Father John shrugged. “Personal items I left behind at his house. A pen, a scarf. He told me they were with the women, and if he were ever caught, I’d be dragged down with him… I was terrified.”

Hattie stayed quiet.

“As the years went on, our relationship continued. We both wanted to keep our eyes on each other. That changed when he died.

“Suddenly, his place became command central. I realized whatever was hidden would probably be found.” He looked directly at Hattie. “That’s when you and your friends came into the house. I was certain you’d come across something. That’s why I bugged the place—to hear what you found. That’s also why I stole your gun and staged the fake shooting... I wanted to scare you off. I thought if the investigation fell apart, no one would find what he’d planted.”

He paused.

“I was desperate,” he said. “And not thinking clearly. Then I left and waited. I figured it would only be a matter of time before the police came for me—but they never did.”

He let out a long breath. “Once I heard how the investigation ended and that all evidence pointed solely to Flynn, I realized he’d been bluffing. Blackmailing me to keep quiet—literally making me pay for his sins.”

A stillness fell between them. She noticed the steam curling from his untouched tea, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weight.

“Do you believe you can find absolution in Buddhism?” she asked.

He pressed his lips together. “I’m not sure I believe in absolution anymore. Only in facing what I’ve done—and letting it change me.”

She took a breath, forcing her voice to stay steady. “Yes. Learning from our mistakes is a gift.”

He nodded, lips parting as though he might speak—then closing again. Outside, a car rumbled past. The day felt hot, but Hattie realized she was shivering.

She looked down at the ledger—an ugly symbol of blackmail and murder. Despite her anger, she found herself wishing he’d fought harder. For the girls. For the truth. But judgment wasn’t hers to make. It was time to move on.

He stood, adjusting his robe. The ghost of a smile flickered across his face. “Thank you for seeing me. For listening.”

She followed him to the door, heart heavy with the weight of everything he hadn’t done. He stepped outside, the sun glinting off his shaved head.

“Take care, Father,” she said softly, catching herself on the last word.

He turned back. “You too. And please—call me John.”


Chapter 67: Going Steady

Hattie and Horatio sat on the porch swing, the sun low and golden. The hum of summer insects filled the quiet, and for a long while, neither of them spoke. Hattie kept her eyes on how the light slanted through the branches, touching everything like grace.

Horatio reached over and gently touched her hand. “Wanna go steady?” he said, his voice playful.

She let out a shaky laugh and looked at him sideways. “Steady? Only if you have a class ring so I can brag.”

“Ring?” he said. “Sure. I think I’ve got one in my stash. From 1978.”

Hattie made some quick calculations in her head. “Weren’t you a little old?”

He smiled. “I’m a slow learner.”

She laughed, feeling guilty—then the tears came, hot and fast, catching her off guard.

Horatio said nothing—he held her as steady as an old oak.

She leaned into him, sobs dissolving into silence. And then, somewhere in that stillness, she realized…

Her tears had changed.

They were no longer for sorrow. They were for something else—the warmth beside her. The slow rise and fall of his chest. The breath she could hear, steady and sure. The way he stayed.

She had found someone.

However long it lasted, however imperfect it might be.

There was so much to cry about in matters of the heart. But sometimes, the tears were joy.

She turned to look at him. A single tear rolled down his cheek, too. Neither of them wiped it away.

“There are good people in the world,” she whispered. “And they outnumber the bad. By far.”

He nodded.

She chuckled, still teary. “Is this what passes for romance at our age?”

“Suppose so,” he said and squeezed her hand.

They sat quietly again. The crickets had taken over the air, the porch light buzzing behind them. The past was not forgotten. But somehow, it was a little easier to carry.

Whatever had made Flynn the way he was, she could do nothing about it now. Except maybe be a little kinder. To others. To herself.

She reached for Horatio’s hand.

They stayed that way for a long time, listening to the evening as the world turned gently toward something new.
